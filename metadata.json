        "abstract": "Jim Crow practices touched every aspect of southern life in the middle of the twentieth century. As surviving documentary evidence attests, archives and archivists in the South, particularly in the University of North Carolina system, were deeply implicated in upholding segregation. This article probes that dynamic relationship, stressing the courage of those African American scholars who challenged Jim Crow on quotidian and organizational bases. The history of segregation in archival repositories illuminates four themes. First, it underlines the agency and power wielded by archival professionals; the archives is never a neutral space. Second, it suggests how archival professionals conducted\u00e2\u0080\u0094or failed to conduct\u00e2\u0080\u0094outreach to attract users and to promote use. In this way they betrayed their professional mission by providing lesser forms of access and service to African Americans. Third, the story of Jim Crow archives shows the need for archivists to be held accountable in their record-collecting and recordkeeping practices; it also demonstrates the central importance of diversity in the profession, in the types of records retained, and in their content. Finally, it indicates the necessity of ensuring that a representative documentary trail remains for historians. In short, archivists affect the writing of history as much in the 2010s as they did in the 1950s. The legacy of Jim Crow's \"strange career\" in the archives represents a valuable lesson for archival professionals in their pursuit of social justice.",

Based on the website content of 96 repositories, 66 survey responses, and 18 interviews, the findings reveal a wide range of practice. While American repositories are generally conservative in that they digitize holdings that present no copyright complications, there is evidence of a shift from an item-level copyright analysis approach to a bolder risk-assessment approach that may better achieve the archival mission to make holdings available for use. The article identifies tools to support a risk-assessment approach and suggests areas of further research to identify best practices.",

        "abstract": "The Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners (MBLC) has collected a unique set of environmental data from storage and display areas in hundreds of cultural institutions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in time frames that spanned the heating and cooling seasons of the year. The goal of this research project was to investigate whether this unique resource of data could be organized, distilled, and synthesized into useful environmental management benchmarks and interpretive guidelines that institutions could use to evaluate their own stewardship and compare it to peer institutions. Utilizing an environmental data analysis software program and metrics designed by the Image Permanence Institute (IPI) to identify and compare preservation quality, the researchers created a detailed statistical analysis of indoor and outdoor environments in Massachusetts by season, region, and institution. The research identified the importance of seasonal climatic differences, the fall season being the most problematic preservation environment management challenge. Institutions must pay close attention to temperature control during periods of high humidity when too much cooling can raise relative humidity to dangerously high levels. The benchmarks and environmental management guidelines developed during this project provide valuable information to institutions in Massachusetts as well as those located in the continental climate zone of the United States.",

Using an organizing structure drawn from rhetorical genre studies, the authors examine the calendars and inventories across four dimensions (textual features, composing processes, reading practices, and social roles) to discover the ways in which these finding aids incorporated and expressed, both explicitly and implicitly, institutional, professional, and social values. The examination of the calendars and inventories suggests that they functioned as \"forms of cultural knowledge\" that shaped and were shaped by PAC's evolving understanding of what it meant to make its holdings accessible to the public and its sense of identity and purpose in relation to that public.",

Research seems to indicate that allowing users to contribute content holds some promise for augmenting traditional description, thus increasing the discoverability of materials. As yet, the practice of allowing user-contributed content has not been widely adopted, especially for large-scale online collections. Because this is not an endeavor to be entered into lightly in terms of required resources or policy considerations, it is important for decision makers to have as much information as possible about who will contribute content and what that content looks like. It is informative to look at the experience of Footnote, an entity with an existing online collection with user contribution functionality. This case study identifies individuals with family connections to a collection as the largest group of contributors, while annotations are the most common type of contribution. The data suggest that users are predominately interested in information about individuals. This study also indicates that there are issues of consistency, authenticity, and context with regard to user-contributed content.",

With the exception of a relatively few specialized institutions and dedicated programs, the identification and preservation of Latino archives are not keeping pace with the nation's fastest growing and increasingly geographically dispersed population. This paper presents two related initiatives, developed in dialogue over the past seven years. It outlines operational practices related to identification of collections in private hands, outreach, trust, and long-term relationships. The paper then provides a practical model and insights for overcoming the day-to-day challenges of identifying and preserving the documentary heritage of the Latino experience and challenges others to undertake such projects.",

This article identifies the unique challenges related to collecting the papers of women state legislators and provides general recommendations for developing basic collecting and selection criteria that incorporate critical thinking about women in elected office. A brief discussion about research use of the papers of women state legislators follows to illustrate how researchers utilize or neglect these collections for various reasons. Finally, this article demonstrates that even though women appear to be entering the political mainstream, archivists need to be continually vigilant of the complexities inherent in documenting women and other underrepresented groups in the American political landscape.",

        "abstract": "Archivists engage in a series of relationships with donors, users, colleagues, and others characterized by respect, reciprocity, obligation, and trust. This article argues that these relationships are covenantal in nature. While they inform the creation of professional associations and allow archivists to promote mutually defined ends, covenant is particularly powerful in the realm of interpersonal relations. There is no formal archival covenant; nevertheless, archivists can forge covenant by internalizing concepts that are integral to it: genuine encounter, sacred obligation, and piety of service. Employing these concepts, archivists situate themselves to act morally, ethically, and justly in pursuit of the archival endeavor.",

This article presents results from two parallel surveys on the economic impact of government archives (state, provincial, territorial, county, and municipal) in the United States and Canada that used indirect measures. It also discusses methodological issues surrounding the measurement of economic impact in archives, libraries, and museums. Although the findings indicate that government archives do support local economies by bringing people into a region or city for research, this impact is moderate. The analyses point to the importance of considering other types of impact, such as social and cultural, alongside economic impact as equally important measures of archives' role in society. The conclusions discuss these findings as well as the need for additional research on direct measures of economic impact and other types of impact to fully understand how archives contribute to their local economies.",

        "abstract": "Almost a decade following the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, most Iraqi state documents stemming from Saddam Hussein's regime remain in the possession of the United States. U.S. military forces seized the majority of them in the invasion and occupation for intelligence exploitation, approximately a hundred pages of records and thousands of audio- and videotapes from Hussein's various bureaucracies of repression. Another 5.5 million pages of secret police files chronicling Hussein's Anfal genocidal campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan in the middle to late 1980s also are in American hands. These were seized by Kurdish forces in the uprising in northern Iraq in March 1991 and removed by the Pentagon in 1992 and 1993 to American soil for safe storage and analysis. Moreover, in 2005, an additional seven million pages that once belonged to the Ba'ath Party and security forces were also spirited out of Iraq by military transport with the assistance of the Iraqi Memory Foundation, a private Washington, D.C.-based group that entered Iraq as an American defense contractor to preserve the records of Saddam Hussein's regime. Each of these various caches of state security documents has been removed from Iraq under highly unique circumstances as a result of internal rebellion and more than a decade of hostilities between the United States and Iraq. This article examines the circumstances surrounding these removals, their custody and use, and the status and limits of the international laws of war regarding their capture and return.",

The investigator conducted a short survey of 16 individuals responsible for the development of digital archival moving image collections to determine their institution's digitization and distribution activities for moving images. Data gathered indicate that institutions exhibit strong interest in moving image digitization projects and online distribution, yet significant perceived and tangible barriers to digitization and distribution continue to restrict the development of digital projects and programs for archival moving images. Institutions have not yet invested significant resources into serious study of archival moving image uses and users, which practitioners and researchers should address to determine the best methods to improve access to such materials.",

Writers are not entirely to blame for their neglect, however, as they develop archival practices idiosyncratically, with little or no guidance from information professionals, and 80% indicate they would welcome instruction on digital preservation.

Games offer a unique advantage for collecting metadata because they can entice users who might normally be inclined to visit archives to explore humanities content and, in the process, contribute to vital records, and they can work in a wide-scale, distributed fashion to collect much more metadata than a typical archives staff member could contribute alone in the same time frame. Metadata Games can be used to enhance knowledge about images associated with particular disciplines and fields, or in interdisciplinary collections. This open-source system is easily customized to meet each institution's needs. By inviting mass participation, Metadata Games opens the door for archivists, researchers, and the public to unearth new knowledge that could radically enhance scholarship across the disciplines. Metadata Games expands what researchers, students, and the public can encounter in their quest to understand the human experience. Games offer great promise for humanities scholarship by uniting the culture of the archives with a diverse user base, including researchers, hobbyists, and gamers.",

A literature review provides the background for the discussion, and a mixed-method study quantitatively and qualitatively examines the accessibility of a number of repository websites. The study first employed automated accessibility checkers to provide an overview of site accessibility, then used in-depth and hands-on content analysis of these sites for more detailed analysis. The author demonstrates that gauging website accessibility requires more than software-generated compliance reports. Evaluating website accessibility necessitates the same commitment to context, nuance, and user needs as does archivists' professional imperative to establish and maintain physical and intellectual control over the archival record.

Using their records as an institutional memory, they searched out old crimes, uncovered false or mendacious confessions, compiled evidence, and provoked new confessions. As the written records of oral confessions, inquisitorial records are peculiarly difficult documents to negotiate, but they are also unusually rich sources for studying the unstable nexus of medieval orality and textuality.",

        "abstract": "This article examines how a postmodern-influenced discourse of identity shapes and influences critical analysis of community archives, both internally and externally, and asks if the accompanying terms of engagement shift focus, to negative effect, from the more pressing needs and challenges of these institutions and projects. Looking to archival professional literature and to a recent self-assessment of the Japanese American National Museum, the article argues that an overarching emphasis on questions of identity can distract community institutions from pragmatic evaluations of sustainable practice and can inadvertently mire archivists in a marginalizing rhetoric that blurs the issues at hand.",

To overcome this barrier to online access for large manuscript collections, the authors developed a method for linking digitized items into the EAD finding aid, which speeds content to the Web at a fraction of the usual cost. In the NHPRC-funded grant Digitizing the Septimus D. Cabaniss Papers, the authors demonstrated this model and developed the work flows and open-source software for implementation.

Since that time, there has been a comparative increase in the diversity of collections and the profession as a whole; however, our archival approaches to diversity continue to be uneven because archivists still have not analyzed the historiography of ethnic archives, including those in the African American community. This article examines the developmental history of African American archives, including segregated collection objectives and internalized social hierarchies, and considers the impact of these variables on broader diversity initiatives of the archival profession.",

It proposes that the past seventy-five years can be construed as a single moment, the moment of the SAA's emergence. The last seventy-five years can be regarded as an era of chronic crisis and evolving frontiers. In fact, our own experience bears a marked resemblance to the 1930s, which seems more current today than it often did to those generations between the thirties and ours. Starkly put, the SAA's founding members are not only our predecessors; they are also our contemporaries.",

Applying contextual integrity to privacy decisions also allows archivists to frame decisions in terms of circulation, rather than as a simple dichotomy between access and restriction. Such nuance is invaluable when considering the impact of making records available digitally.",

The former focuses on issues of power, memory, and identity centered upon the initial inscription of a document (or series of documents). The latter concentrates on the subsequent history of documents over time, including the many interventions by archivists (and others) that transform (and change) that original archive into archives. Despite making good common cause in lobbying over public policy and initially sharing values based on objective, scientific history, the two professions have drifted apart in recent decades. This essay explores the reasons for this divergence by analyzing the history of the two professions and highlighting resulting misconceptions that blind both to deeper nuances of the multiple contexts surrounding records that may enhance their understanding and use. It concludes that archives are not unproblematic storehouses of records awaiting the historian, but active sites of agency and power. Until recently, it has been in the interests of both professions to deny (or at least not interrogate) the subjectivity of archives. Both professions could benefit significantly, therefore, from a renewed partnership centered upon the history of the record to produce better history.",

This article discusses why pluralist approaches might help to achieve greater diversity and cultural sensitivity in practice and scholarship. It addresses three key components of such approaches: identifying ways in which dominant cultural paradigms narrow archival pedagogy and practice; envisioning and exploring alternatives to these paradigms; and developing an archival educational framework to promote a critique of professional and societal norms and include diverse perspectives on archival theory and practice. The article calls for a broader conversation on these issues engaging archival academics and students, professional associations, roundtables and caucuses, accrediting bodies, archival employers, funding agencies, and the diverse communities who create, manage, and use records.",

One of the most exciting advances of the last decade has been the development of archival content management (ACM) systems that enable archivists to effectively manage information about their collections. Unfortunately, these systems have the unintended consequence of perpetuating the problem of backlogs by augmenting archivists' current fixation on processing as the solution. This article examines how business process management (BPM) can be used to better understand the archival business process and highlights the importance of taking a holistic approach to solving problems such as the backlog. It also looks at how concepts from BPM have the potential to improve ACM systems-particularly through the integration of workflow management.",

Although people can discover, use, and interpret records and manuscripts in new ways, archivists lack a systematic understanding of how people interact with the descriptive information and digital objects that they create and post online.

By interpreting Web analytics data in light of repository goals and other information concerning use (such as usability studies), repositories can dramatically improve access, increase use, and heighten user satisfaction.",

The digital terrain poses both possibilities and problems for indigenous peoples as they seek to manage, revive, circulate, and create new cultural heritage within overlapping colonial/postcolonial histories and oftentimes-binary public debates about access in a digital age. While digital technologies allow for items to be repatriated quickly, circulated widely, and annotated endlessly, these same technologies pose challenges to some indigenous communities who wish to add their expert voices to public collections and also maintain some traditional cultural protocols for the viewing, circulation, and reproduction of some materials. This case study examines one collaborative archival project aimed at digitally repatriating and reciprocally curating cultural heritage materials of the Plateau tribes in the Pacific Northwest.",

The dispute over the records' past and discussion about their future reveals a larger political struggle over the custody of records seized during wartime. Prevailing international law deems these records cultural property and provides legal guidelines for their treatment and return. Ethical arguments in favor of the seizure highlight the protection of the records as well as their accessibility to international researchers and human rights lawyers, while arguments against the seizure stress the importance of the records to the formation of national identity and nation-building in Iraq. Underlying the political, legal, and ethical arguments surrounding these records are two contrasting views of cultural property: on the one hand, cultural property is seen as an expression of national rights to which members of a nation are entitled, and, on the other hand, access to cultural property is seen as a universal human right to which all people, regardless of national affiliation, are entitled. This paper concludes by suggesting a third, postcolonial approach to cultural property.",

The study is a qualitative investigation involving independent case studies of seven people who have extensive experience using the photographic archives preserved by the Library of Congress. This article contextualizes the research in a range of literatures, summarizes the research methodology, and presents findings from in-depth interviews that focus on how visually experienced users choose digitized photographs for inclusion in a given project. By understanding these \"modes of seeing\" the contemporary digitized visual archives, archivists are in a better position to understand the representational implications of their digitization processes.",

Buddhist and Christian monks and monasteries played similar roles in preserving both religious and secular texts, but the archival role of Christian monks was limited to monastic archives, whereas Buddhist monks were integral to the management of both monastic and secular archives. The establishment early in the Koryo dynasty (918-1392) of a centralized bureaucratic system required a centralized archival system, of which monastic archives were one branch. These monastic archives were managed by one of the major government departments of the secular authority and by Buddhist officials, who consisted largely of Buddhist monks. The findings of this study suggest that different political and social structures in medieval Korea and Europe, as well as the differing religious philosophies and cultures of Buddhism and Christianity, resulted in divergent archival development in the two societies.",

New digital technologies have also facilitated the expression and archiving of ethnic voices.",

The project seeks to provide a picture of the state of the field for archivists in colleges and universities. Initially funded by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Electronic Records Fellowship Program, the study collected data in 2005 from 193 institutions through an online survey administered to 638 archivists and records managers. The survey was followed by interviews with archivists at 20 institutions to explore in depth the development and implementation of their programs. In 2009, a second online survey was sent to the 193 institutions responding in 2005 to identify what changes, if any, had occurred over the four-year period. Sixty-five percent (126) of the original 193 institutions updated their 2005 data, and the results suggest relatively little change in the development of ERM programs over the past four years.",

This article offers a solution to mitigate these risks. Implementing the needed software would be a small addition to widely deployed CM offerings. This long-term preservation solution, devised for cultural and scholarly digital documents, is already structured to support archival principles for business records, and the article describes this Trustworthy Digital Object (TDO) architecture and its design core sufficiently to show how archivists can participate in managing digital repositories that conform and are attuned to the particular needs of any archival institution.",

        "abstract": "The author re-examines, after twenty-five years, the influences on his ideas in the initial development of documentation strategies, reviewing in detail his preparation for the 1984 SAA program session at which documentation strategies were first presented. He explores the links between these ideas and several of his roles during that period, particularly as first director of the Historical Records Program at NHPRC from 1975 to 1981, as chair of the 1982 SAA Program Committee, and in the creation of the first Task Force, and then the Committee, on Goals and Priorities for the Archival Profession. He identifies four core approaches to assessment, planning, and advocacy for the profession that he drew from his experience, and he argues that his conceptual model and related proposals for documentation strategies flowed logically from these core approaches, which have much broader application. The author speculates that re-examining the origins of documentation strategies, and the period in which these ideas were developed, may suggest to the archives profession that it should refocus more directly and vigorously on the larger issue of archival conditions in the United States and on how to advocate directly with particular parties essential to addressing them.",

Recordkeepers at the time failed to copy the schedules or to bind them, driven both by the era's pervasive fiscal conservatism and bureaucratic hubris over the first use of the Hollerith electrical tabulating machines. Thus the stage was set for the infamous fire of 10 January 1921. The loss of a large portion of the 1890 census did not, as previously assumed, spur the creation of the National Archives. Nevertheless, the impact of the fire and subsequent disposal of the remnants of the census left a permanent void in the historical record.",

It identifies parameters within which documentation strategy can be effectively implemented and provides thinking points for using this approach in the digital age.",

The Archivio Segreto Vaticano is the most important of these repositories, and descriptions of its holdings form the bulk of the publication. This article revisits this project ten years after publication to assess its contribution and the extent to which work at the various Vatican repositories has improved on the work done by the Michigan team. This retrospective explores issues relating to the limits of information technology, the complications of joint projects, the role of scholars in the descriptive process, and the need for conceptual frameworks in digital-based description.",

        "abstract": "This essay examines the contemporary restoration of legacy moving images. It argues that new technologies of restoration confront the archival profession with the need to reassess traditional methodologies and to articulate new theoretical frameworks. It introduces a range of conceptual problems including the nature and status of archival materials that require restoration and reconstitution, the desire to return moving images to their original states, and the differences between object-oriented and time- or event-oriented knowledge systems. A case study discusses three distinct archival representations of Marian Anderson's Lincoln Memorial Concert in 1939, which are symptomatic of a major shift within the moving image archival field. The paper suggests that the UCLA Film and Television Archive's experimental treatment of its archival footage of this historic concert represents an exemplary departure from the field's traditional and doctrinaire orientation toward neutrality and cautiousness. In addition to their previous role as custodians of legacy materials, archivists have now also begun to operate more openly as historical agents to fill in historical gaps by producing new works.",

It identifies barriers to implementation such as lack of staff and a gap between the technology needed to publish EAD and the skills of many archivists. It discusses solutions and recommends changing the emphasis of EAD training, using server-friendly software, and engaging consultants to bolster archivists' technology expertise.",

As noted by one of Armstrong's biographers, however, Armstrong's character was \"buffeted by the forces of racism and commercialism.\" From the perspective of the archives, Armstrong's reaction to these influences was a form of psychological withdrawal that often coalesced around his interaction with recording technologies. Armstrong developed an intimate relationship with audio recording and relied upon its particular form of capture to shape a posthumous identity that was beyond the distortive influences that shaped his public and commodified image, and that was appreciably honest in its relationship with, to use Armstrong's word, \"posterity\"",

These challenges prompt us not only to give more attention to local and regional needs in developing our education programs, but also to examine more broadly their implications for archival education, theory, and practice globally. This paper begins by discussing the diverse nature of Pacific Rim countries, cultures, and communities, and then raises issues relating to the archival educational needs of its Indigenous and minority communities. It then reports the findings of the first phase of \"Pluralizing the Archival Paradigm through Education,\" a collaborative project examining archival education in Pacific Rim nations and whether it meets the needs of Indigenous and local ethnic communities. Its findings to date suggest a need to develop and deliver culturally sensitive and responsive archival curricula and associated pedagogy inclusive of local and Indigenous knowledge and practices. They also suggest a need for the integration of such knowledge and practices into the global paradigm within which archival theory and practice are situated, thus making that paradigm more inclusive and less in danger of being a hegemonic or even neocolonial force.",

Archivists and records managers perceive certain records as prototypical, while other records are more distant from their mental prototypes. Prototype effects apply both to item-level records and to record aggregations. Moreover, the boundaries of the record concept are fuzzy, and some records are \"boundary objects\" shared with other communities.

Yet, from a professional perspective, archivists have not gathered adequate information regarding the readiness of repositories to acquire digital records created outside of their control, or to preserve and make such records accessible. The profession lacks baseline data regarding the state of electronic records planning within the community of repositories that acquire materials outside institutional recordkeeping programs, frequently labeled \"collecting\" repositories. This paper reports the results of a survey of academic libraries, historical societies, and libraries between 10 July and 12 August 2006. The author developed the survey to determine the level to which these repositories are working with born-digital records. The data indicate that repositories are indeed acquiring born-digital materials, but are proceeding on a case-by-case basis rather than developing specific policies for their acquisition, access, and preservation.",

It discusses the development of the Polar Bear Expedition Digital Collections, an online access tool employing Web 2.0 technologies and evaluation of the first six months of its deployment (January-June 2006). Using Web analytics, an online survey, semistructured interviews, and content analysis of comments, the researchers explore visitors' initial reactions, and their uses of and interactions with this new type of finding aid. The study also offers insights from other disciplines and considers how social navigation features might enhance accessibility to archival materials. Initial findings suggest that enabling direct and indirect interaction among visitors and archivists, collaborative filtering, and other Web 2.0 features might make archival materials more accessible and enrich the traditional finding aid.",

Teaching and testing K-12 students require analysis of primary documents, so that archival records take their place alongside the test tube and the textbook in many American classrooms. These trends represent an opportunity for archives to expand their patron base, establish contacts in the community, contribute to the vitality of public education in their communities, and cultivate the next generation of archives' users, donors, and supporters.

By the 1960s, the flourishing public archives programs and the emergence of the new social history spurred a boom in labor archives. This boom ended in the 1980s, as unions faced tougher times and many institutions cut their support for archives programs. Today, the survival of labor archives programs depends on archivists forging a closer relationship with the labor movement, especially by establishing records- and knowledge-management partnerships. But first they must prove their worth to the labor movement. This process begins by examining the history, theory, and practice of the discipline.",

MASC librarians and management determined that these collections, as well as MASC's historical photograph collections, should be systematically surveyed and assessed, so that a prioritized preservation treatment plan could be developed. MASC librarians designed and executed two separate surveys, one for photograph collections and one for manuscripts. The manuscript portion of the survey project, which supported the development of a comprehensive preservation treatment plan for processed manuscript collections, is the subject of this article.",

There were additional questions for those with management responsibilities, and specific questions for members of certain professional associations.

The analysis is conducted through a comparison of accountability in traditional post-hoc archival description with description in the continuum-based model of recordkeeping. The author suggests that while both approaches have validity as tools of documentary accountability within their spheres, neither alone can ensure the wider accountability of an institution to itself or to society at large. A broader organizational and social accountability is necessary to ensure the integrity not just of current and historical records, but also of the larger spectrum of actions of the agency responsible for creating and keeping those records.",

This essay explores the early history of the Mississippi State Archives through the activities and practices of its first archivist, Dunbar Rowland. Rowland was not only a member of the first generation of southern state archivists, but was also a member of the Mississippi planter elite and an aspirant to participating both in the wider world of archival practice and thought and in the post-Reconstruction interpretation of southern history. This investigation divides Rowland's work into three periods: foundation, collection, and publication, and argues that Rowland's example shows how archival practice itself can reflect the stance of its times toward the construction of public memory.",

Each of the different phases of archival development in presidential records management was triggered by democratic developments in the country's political system, which illustrates the close relationship between political structure and public archives in modern Korea. To examine this relationship, this study investigates the history of presidential records in Korea during three eras: the era of the absence of public records under authoritarian regimes (1948-1993), the era of the establishment of the basic principle for managing presidential records under two civilian administrations (1993-2003), and the era of new prospects for public archives under a new government (2003-present). This historical approach emphasizes that democratic entities are necessary to set up and manage an archival system for presidential records and to ensure public access to these records.",

This paper reports on a research project that evaluated the effectiveness of continuing education experiences for increasing participants' skills in digital preservation and their ability to implement these skills in their repositories. The research project studied the impact of four workshops and five seminars in an international setting sponsored by the Electronic Resource Preservation and Access Network (ERPANET). The study findings indicate that the participants viewed the training events as successful, but that very few participants were able to implement the skills once they returned to their work environments. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of these kinds of training events and looks carefully at how they can be realistically measured.",

The paper issues a call for archivists to rethink the way they process collections, particularly large contemporary collections.

Probably few archivists and other records professionals know that the antecedents of their profession are well represented in such a popular tourist attraction. This essay considers three lessons for archivists in their quest for greater public understanding and support, drawing on how this old public records structure has been interpreted. First, the essay suggests that the story of the Secretary's Office is not well known by archivists and those interested in the history of efforts to preserve our documentary heritage. Second, the essay recounts the story of the failure by America's premier and pioneering historic site to interpret fully the legacy of the public records office. Finally, the essay indicates that the lack of interpretation represents a lost opportunity to promote public understanding of what records represent, why archives are important, and the work of archivists.",

        "abstract": "Historians are expert researchers who use a variety of methods to locate primary research material in archives, including consulting the archivist. This article suggests that historical researchers deliberately establish relationships with archivists to tap into their in-depth knowledge about archival resources. The relationship with the archivist is the social capital of historical researchers because through it they are able to gain access to this specialized knowledge. This article examines the strategies undertaken by historical researchers to establish these relationships and their evaluation of the relationships in terms of finding resources. It also examines the difference in access to the archivist between established historical researchers and PhD students and speculates on how the availability of archival resources and finding aids on the World Wide Web might affect the relationships between researchers and archivists.",

By tapping into the sympathies of many priests for the labor movement as well as the devout Catholicism of many union organizers, however, the CUA managed to compile an impressive body of labor records at a time when very few archives were collecting such records. This article explores how different priests and bishops developed and maintained this collection over the years. The history of the collecting of labor records at CUA offers insight into the various internal and external factors that influence collection development practices and acquisition policies over time.",

This paper discusses the issues involved in overseeing modern collections in which there are privacy and confidentiality issues, and it focuses on the special challenges presented by the papers of authors and other celebrities. These challenges are the result of the high level of public interest in celebrities' papers, the personal matters discussed in correspondence in these collections, the potential for issues of privacy to be intertwined with copyright, and the fact that repositories increasingly collect the archives of living authors and celebrities as the papers are being created.",

The study provides insights into how users navigate archival descriptive information and how archivists and digital librarians might design interfaces that facilitate efficient search strategies. Experienced archival users and novices utilize different methods of searching for archival information. Interface elements such as alphabetical lists, page-top tables of contents, and single-page search options enabled both expert and novice users to conduct more efficient searches than did alternate designs.",

Codes of ethics are placed within the context of concepts of professionalism and the relationships between and among archivists, records creators, records users, employers, and the public at large. Several codes issued by archival professional organizations are used to illustrate the ways in which the structure of codes influences their effectiveness in communicating the nature of the profession to the public. The paper concludes that ethics codes contribute to an enhanced sense of professionalism for archivists that can strengthen their ability to serve the public by creating more autonomy in decision making. Paying greater attention to the language used in constructing codes of ethics can help accomplish this task.",

        "abstract": "The common-law tradition inherited by the United States restricted access to public records to those with a direct and tangible interest in the information, such as parties to a lawsuit. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, state appellate courts ruled in a series of cases that revolutionized legal thought on this subject. By the end of World War I, these tribunals increasingly assumed that citizenship itself provided sufficient justification for access to public records. Abstractors and insurers of real estate titles, whose interests were commercial, led the assault upon the common-law tradition that had imposed the more restrictive standard. Suits initiated by those concerned with the misuse of public funds and honest elections played a relatively small role in bringing about this change. The story of this landmark litigation between title abstract companies and local government officials again demonstrates that custody of public records carries with it risks and responsibilities all too familiar to modern archivists.",

This new \"Time of Troubles\" imposed heavy personal burdens on all who work in the archival service, and it posed extraordinary professional challenges. During the 1990s, archival directors and archivists in Russia and Ukraine faced a decade of extreme privation and trial, but they responded with a stoic heroism.",

This article examines political posters as an example of this useful but undercollected class of materials, from the vantage point of their research value and the challenges they pose to institutions that collect them. Such challenges include the nontraditional production and distribution modes that make acquisition of political posters difficult; the lack of consensus on cataloging methods; the preservation problems arising from the political poster's function to communicate quickly but ephemerally in public spaces; and the technical and copy-right issues associated with digitization. Solutions are proposed in each of these areas in an effort to identify best practices and enable institutions to assist scholars with adequate collections to meet the needs of evolving research agendas.",

Yet, archivists have never defined what characteristics denote an expert user of archives. This article reports on a research study involving in-depth interviews with twenty-eight individuals. The analysis of these interviews led to the development of a model of researcher expertise that might be incorporated into archival user education to create information literacy for primary sources. The authors assert that there are three distinct forms of knowledge required to work effectively with primary sources: domain (subject) knowledge, artifactual literacy, and the authors' own concept of archival intelligence. Archival intelligence is a researcher's knowledge of archival principles, practices, and institutions, such as the reason underlying archival rules and procedures, the means for developing search strategies to explore research questions, and an understanding of the relationship between primary sources and their surrogates. This is separate from domain or subject knowledge and artifactual literacy, or the ability to interpret and analyze primary sources. Archival intelligence encompasses three dimensions: 1) knowledge of archival theory, practices, and procedures; 2) strategies for reducing uncertainty and ambiguity when unstructured problems and ill-defined solutions are the norm; 3) and intellective skills.",

The findings provide information on the stages of genealogical research, how genealogists search for information, the access tools they use, the knowledge required, and the barriers they face. The findings of this study can be used to improve the design of archival information systems that will facilitate access for this important group of users.",

        "abstract": "President George W. Bush's Executive Order No. 13,233, issued on 1 November 2001, marked the latest attempt by the executive branch to circumvent or otherwise nullify the key provisions of the Presidential Records Act. Congress passed the Presidential Records Act in 1978 in the wake of the Watergate scandals to assure public ownership and control over presidential materials. Nonetheless, starting with the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who was the first president to be covered by the act, the executive branch has repeatedly attacked the statute through various regulatory schemes and overly broad claims of executive privilege. Indeed, with their historical reputations and legacies at stake, presidents have never fully accepted the concept of yielding control over their presidential materials. This article reviews the troubling history of the Presidential Records Act and the implications of the latest attempts to restrict access to presidential papers.",

        "abstract": "While many archivists and librarians have celebrated oral history's documentary potential, others have questioned its reliance on faulty and subjective memory. The role of archivists as curator of collections or creator of records, an issue that has arisen anew in recent years, is central to this oral history debate. Drawing on fifty years of archival, library, and oral history scholarship, this article examines how the introduction of oral history in archives and libraries has challenged and informed archival theory and practice in the United States. The article argues that oral history's contribution and impact in the twenty-first century will depend on archivists' and librarians' ability and willingness to work together, in collaboration with other disciplines, to document and provide access to our oral heritage in the digital age.",

The paper places a discussion of the case study data collection, analysis, and outcomes in the context of the quest and rationale for effective methods and a research design that would allow InterPARES researchers to discern the parameters of the electronic record and what supports a presumption of its authenticity.",

The project developed a policy for identifying collections to actively pursue and for evaluating collections offered. To develop the policy, the authors adapted the Minnesota Method, an appraisal methodology developed by the Minnesota Historical Society to appraise business records. The article serves as a case study of the application of the Minnesota Method to a collecting repository within an academic setting.",

These strategies include preservation techniques (e.g., refreshing, migration, emulation); selection for preservation; staffing configurations; cost modeling; access to preserved records; and policymaking. Particular attention is paid to three broad areas: the evolution of the definition of \"preservation,\" the role of costing in preserving electronic records, and the gap in policy development in which to situate and strategize the present and future preservation of electronic records. By documenting the variety of approaches that are being taken, the authors seek not only to shed light on current practices, but also to offer informed consideration on where preservation might be headed.",

The focus of this paper is the current state of deployment methods for EAD, including how long and what types of deployment methods are being used, why they were selected, what changes, if any, are being planned, and what types of challenges are associated with them. The paper also focuses on archivists' perception of end-user utilization of EAD and explores the evaluation upon which this perception is based, including how and on what basis archivists formulate their perceptions.",

The analysis, which has been developed for archival education in Italy, is carried out through an examination of the historical evolution of the main functions for records creation (classification and the registry system) and the evaluation of their effectiveness in the newly developed and technologically advanced records systems. Special attention is given to the risks posed by new Italian and European rules on electronic records. These rules are based on the use of digital signature as the only guarantee for a record's reliability and authencity. It is argued, however, that the digital organization of the records, even if updated and improved, cannot be efficient if it ignores the traditional functional requirements for recordkeeping.",

This paper provides brief descriptive statistics drawn from an Internet listserv survey conducted in May 1998, and then analysis related to proving authenticity; the difficulties of judging something authentic; and definitions of authenticity as used and understood in the context of respondents' professional activity. The analysis provides indications of how professionals actually understand and use the concept of authenticity in their professional work depending on the context; and how these professionals react differently to paper records and electronic records. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this preliminary analysis fits within the context of the outcomes of prior electronic records research.",

Written collection development policies are advocated as a way to ensure that collections have a coherent and well-defined focus, while cooperative collecting practices are seen as a way to ensure that related materials are not scattered among far-flung repositories and that repositories' scarce resources are not needlessly squandered on unnecessary competitiveness for collections. However, not only are there numerous impediments to the effectiveness of either of these tools, many repositories do not use them. A survey of manuscript repositories reveals some of the reasons why more repositories do not engage in these practices, while quantitatively demonstrating the benefits they offer to repositories that do.",

From 1995 to 1999, e-mail became the preferred method of inquiry, more questions came from casual users researching for personal reasons, more users took advantage of online holdings information to shape their reference questions, and the proportion of remote users visiting in person decreased. The paper concludes by suggesting ways for archivists to prepare for new influxes of remote researchers and methods to improve remote reference services.",

This study analyzed 375 e-mail reference questions submitted to provincial, federal, university, city and special archives in order to determine, from the users' own words, how users formulate reference requests to archives. Understanding what elements the archives' client uses to describe his or her information need enables the creation of more relevant archival descriptive tools. According to this analysis, people used proper names, dates, places, subject, form, and, occasionally, events when composing their information request. As archives move toward a greater presence on the World Wide Web, archivists should design electronic information systems that account for the information seeking patterns expressed in e-mail refrence requests.",

A random sample of on-line finding aids was selected and then searched using AltaVista, Excite, Fast Search, Google, Hotbot, and Northern Light, employing both word- and phrase-searching. As of February 2000, approximately 8 percent of repositories listed at the \"Repositories of Primary Resources\" web site had mounted at least four full finding aids on the Web. The most striking finding of this study was the importance of using phrase searches whenever possible, rather than word searches. Also of significance was the fact that if a finding aid were to be found using any search engine, it was generally found in the first ten or twenty items at most. The study identifies the best performers among the six chosen search engines. Combinations of search engines often produced much better results than did the search engines individually, evidence that there may be little overlap among the top hits provided by individual engines.",

They represent a set of standards against which the administration of particular archives can be measured. The relationship of formal laws and regulations to actual archival practices is still a limited one, however. Because of this limited relationship, archivists and the scholars who use archival collections are involved in political contests with state authorities over who controls the information in an archives. The history of the archives of the U.S.S.R. and the states of the former Soviet Union exemplifies these conflicts and the necessity of adhering to professional ethical standards in the absence of legal regulation.",

In 1917, when the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark, Danish archivists removed the majority of records created there during colonial rule and deposited them in the Danish National Archives. Following its establishment in the 1930s, the National Archives of the United States sent an archivist to the Virgin Islands to claim most of the remaining records and ship them to Washington. The native population of the Virgin Islands, primarily former colonials whose ancestors were brought from Africa as slaves, were left without access to the written sources that comprised their history. While all three parties have claims to custody of the records, the claim of the people of the Virgin Islands relies on an expanded definition of provenance that includes territoriality or locale, as well as on a custodial responsiblity for access. The competing custodial claims suggest a dissonance between legal custody, physical custody, and archival principles that may be resolvable through post-custodial management practices.",

Furthermore, interesting contrasts and comparisons can be made between graduates of history and graduates of library and/or information science-based programs, as well as between men and women in terms of employment sectors, salaries, and the length of the graduate programs. Understanding career trajectories is important in building a stronger archival profession in the United States, as well as in fostering professionalization among the younger generation.",

This is particularly important as archives and archivists go through a paradigm shift from provenance defined by stable offices and roles to one of dynamic process-bound information. In all stages of records and archives management and archival usage, the socially and culturally defined \"software of the mind\" plays a role. This new \"archivistics\" demands that archival education be comparative and multi-disciplinary. Likewise, research in archival science, broadly defined, is a key instrument for experimenting, inventing, changing, and improving professional education.",

        "abstract": "Recent archival literature reflects a number of diverse definitions of the role of the archivist. Many older assessments stress a more cohesive definition: the need for archivists to be all to all archives, equally representing users and administrators, creators and researchers. The challenge created by contemporary records is not to change this fundamental role, first expressed over two hundred years ago during the French Revolution, but to create new ways to fulfill it. The task requires making three crucial distinctions: between the archivist's methods and the archival mission, between the archivist's work and archival functions, and between professional issues and archival science issues. Only by learning how to strike a balance between the needs of archivists as individuals and the collective identity of the archival profession can the challenges of contemporary records be met. An earlier version of this article was delivered on August 26, 1999, as the author's presidential address at the annual meeting of the Society of American Archivists held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",

The first six years of the newly formed National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) were devoted to the development of state structures to assist in the program's implementation, and national priorities that could address questions of documentary preservation and enhanced researcher use. The debates within the Commission and among archivists nationwide during the startup period centered on three questions: how much appropriated funding would be provided to the Commission for grants?; what role should the states play in shaping and implementing the program?; and what priorities should be established in order to advance the solution to national research needs? The staff, the Commission members, the Archivist of the United States, the state archivists, and the professional archival organizations all became important contributors to the initiation of the first national effort to improve archival processes and the condition of documentary resources in the United States.",

Recent intellectual debate has examined questions of national, ethnic, gender, class, and community identities, of individual and group identity, and of the formation of identity. A spectrum of positions has emerged from this debate. On one end, identity is viewed as \"real,\" intrinsic to individuals and communities or even biologically based. On the other, identity is conceived of as social fiction, constructed culturally for political and historical reasons. On the whole, serious scholars have rejected the former view. Archivists should be cognizant of this fact because they are major players in the business of identity politics, whether they are conscious of it or not. Archivists appraise, collect, and preserve the props with which notions of identity are built. In turn, notions of identity are confirmed and justified as historical documents validate their authority.",

Keyword, phrase, and Boolean searches were developed using the topical subject headings; keyword and phrase searches were conducted for each personal name. The first one hundred documents retrieved by each search were examined to determine the number of SHC finding aids retrieved. The study found that searches often retrieved unmanageably large result sets and that the majority of SHC finding aids containing the search terms were not among the first one hundred documents retrieved. These results suggest that on-line archival descriptions are often not accessible through common methods of Internet searching and that archivists must continue to develop means to help researchers locate their collections.",

Byrd's claim to be the first to fly to the North Pole was challenged by his contemporaries and by later historians. The diary provided new evidence, and the news of its existence and meaning fueled stories that reached every part of the globe. Interest in Byrd also inspired producers of three documentaries. The archivist who dealt with reporters and producers discusses the media coverage, the challenges of working with reporters and producers of documentaries, and the impact of the publicity on an archival program.",

It argues that context is essential to understanding archives and that archives are creators and reinforcers of power and authority. Finally, it considers two archetypal archives, assemblages of clay tokens in the ancient Near East, and today's World Wide Web, to suggest the importance of considering archives' connectivity and context in order to understand their use and power.",

A unit within the OSS Research and Analysis Branch, the Central Information Division, collected most of these documents and managed their use for intelligence analysis with the creation of an intricate card indexing system. The Central Information Division's careful tracking of information made possible present-day archival use of the cards and the records they index.",

In this article, the findings of the IU project are reviewed in the context of several questions project personnel addressed during the project, including 1) Does the Pitt model ask the right questions? 2) What set of activities are required to use and implement the model? 3) What are the costs associated with implementing the model? and 4) What types of skills are required to apply the methodology.",

A content analysis of twenty finding aids to archival collections and their corresponding archival MARC records was conducted. The data suggest that the level of representation in archival MARC records varies depending on subject category. Geographical terms were the most likely to be represented, followed by personal names, chronological terms, and lastly corporate names. Allowing for the searching of full-text electronic finding aids would enable end users to benefit not only from the subject information present at the collection level and in the abstract, but also from the areas in finding aids that tend to get less MARC representation: scope/content notes, historical/biographical information, series summaries, and container information.",

It was found that subject terms, both generic and specific, were used far more frequently than any other categories of terms in requests for photographs. Generic subject terms appeared most often in requests, indicating the importance of these terms for indexing. Time and place were the next most commonly used types of terms.

The rise of England as a nation-state not only created a spirit of insular nationalism but also engendered political, religious, and legal controversies.

This dramatic growth in the use of historical records pointed out the need for improved recordkeeping procedures.

This is very much like the move of databases toward more explicit, unambiguous, standardized forms. The data found in documents is quite different from traditional, tabular database records, however, and requires new models. SGML has been at the center of this move because of some very simple characteristics, such as allowing authors to create the particular labels needed for their specific applications. These characteristics led to its use by the Text Encoding Initiative and for Encoded Archival Description.

Organizational structures, resources, and programs vary greatly, but state archivists and records administrators have developed common principles and share innovations through organizations that enhance their ability to cooperate and communicate, particularly the National Association of Government Archives and Records Administrators and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. Priorities and challenges facing these programs include asserting archival concerns as information-related policies and regulations evolve, developing programs for managing and preserving electronic records, and using information technologies to improve access to records.",

Government is flattening, becoming smaller and more intergovernmental in nature. The increasing use of information technology and telecommunications in government makes its records more vulnerable, more valuable commercially, and more accessible. Government archives will take on new roles as regulator, negotiator, and advocate for the management of records. To be successful in this volatile future, government archives must build expertise in management issues, such as privacy, security, access and retrieval, and long-term retention, and closer ties with constituents within and outside the government.",

There has never been a time since the rise of the modern corporation when companies have not bought other companies, restructured their operations, entered new businesses, and consolidated, sold, or spun off operations. In addition to these realities, the terms downsizing and outsourcing\u00e2\u0080\u0094and all that they portend for employees\u00e2\u0080\u0094have become bywords as business\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not only business\u00e2\u0080\u0094seeks to wring more productivity from the workforce. These trends have inevitably affected corporate records. Archives and records management units have been closed and records destroyed or transferred to warehouses, while the rate of establishment and growth of in-house corporate archives has diminished greatly. If one believes that the records of business are an integral part of American history, and that the place of corporations in that history needs to be documented and accessible, then the fate of those business records and the archives themselves is a matter of some importance. This essay explores the progression of events in the past twenty years, and reviews both the expected and the unexpected results that downsizing and outsourcing have actually produced for archives.",

        "abstract": "Since its founding, Baker Library has collected rare and unique materials to support the curriculum of the Harvard Business School. Today, Baker Library holds one of the preeminent collections of historical materials on business history and economic philosophy in the world. Included in the collections are manuscripts, rare books, pamphlets, broadsides, photographs, prints, trade catalogs, trade cards, and annual reports. The earliest records extend back to the banking and patronage activities of the Medici family in the fifteenth century. Harvard Business School students and faculty as well as leaders in the field have used this resource material to learn from the experiences of the past and to understand the historical development of business functions. More recently, however, the material has also been drawing ever-increasing numbers of international students and scholars from a broad range of disciplines, such as cultural anthropology, ethnic and gender studies, industrial archaeology, sociology, fine and decorative arts, maritime history, and engineering. This essay presents an overview of the Baker Library collection, traces changing uses and users, and reviews current plans for the future of the collection and its place within the Harvard Business School and the wider world of American business history.",

Challenges continue to lie ahead for the Society. However, if its fundamental components are sound, SAA should have the flexibility and determination to meet these challenges.",

The field created a structure which is formed by certain steps to be taken in the study and analysis of a document according to a taxonomy. He concludes by examining diplomatics in the 1950s when the field, though rooted in the analysis of ancient documents, tests the borderlines between documentary analysis and historical research.",

The author advocates the application of diplomatics methods to the study of these modern documents. He also presents several examples that underscore the importance of the form of the document in undertaking the decision processes and activities of an administrative body; also that text edition remains for our own time as well as for earlier periods, the ideal testing ground for the techniques of diplomatics.",

Some are suggesting that the new appraisal literature be evaluated for its application to preservation selection. This article reviews the literature covering archival appraisal's role in the process of selection for preservation in archives, and addresses recent efforts to create archival preservation assessment and selection tools. It also provides overviews of some modern appraisal models which are intended for collections and preservation archivists who are working with selection-for-preservation issues. The author suggests that archivists need to concern themselves less with implementing preservation selection tools. They must concentrate first on understanding the values that make archival records significant, and then rationalize their preservation selection decision-making processes. Then, and only then, should the decisions' hierarchy and flow be incorporated into a preservation assessment and selection tool that is adaptable to individual archival institutions, yet consistent enough to yield comparable data.",

The records share, however, some common characteristics--their awkward sizes, their fragile physical form and increasing electronic existence, and their ever increasing volume. Little has been written on the archival view of appraisal and selection criteria for architectural records. With this in mind, and with the belief that a documentation strategy would provide a useful beginning to set appraisal guidelines, the Working Conference on Establishing Principles for the Appraisal and Selection of Architectural Records was held in April 1994 at the Canadian Centre for Architecture. At the conference, archivists, curators, and users gathered to discuss the inherent principles and problems in the appraisal and selection of architectural records, and to propose an agenda for the future analysis of these issues and for the development of a model documentation strategy.",

In dealing with these questions--and with the massive growth rate of current records--the traditional approach to appraisal based on present and future research value is of little use. Documentation strategy is a relatively new approach to appraisal, and stresses a macro-appraisal and selection of the functions, activities, and record creators that need to be documented for posterity. The understanding of records in their overall context provided by macro-appraisal will ensure a more complete documentary record, but will require archivists to become actively involved in determining which records survive, not passively waiting to appraise and select those records which find the way to archival repositories on their own.",

It recognizes the inherent problem of volume with modern records, and provides a way for records creators, custodians, and users to work together to create a plan for which documentation will be preserved. Since it was first introduced in 1984, documentation strategy has met with mixed reactions from the archival profession, and has received its most theoretical examination from the Canadian archival community. With a role in the worlds of both archival theory and archival practice, documentation strategy can be applied to the appraisal of architectural records with the development of broad goals for documenting architecture through the coordination of records creators, custodians, and users, and through the creation of institutional archives.",

In view of the great diversity within the profession, evidently it is not because of any particular external characteristics or interests that we share. Instead, three core attitudes shape the professional life of archivists and draw us to this profession. These are a commitment to service, an ability to search for evidence and meaning in the documentary record, and a rich appreciation of the passing human scene.",

        "abstract": "Archival traditions and practices, together with each archivist's particular situation, not only vary greatly around the world, but within countries and types of institutions within those countries as well. These diverse traditions provide only a limited basis for shared identities between archivists, but they are ultimately linked by the common practice of each archivist of adapting universal archival principles to fit his or her institution's own circumstances. The International Council on Archives provides a forum to encourage international cooperation among archivists and opportunities for those in similar institutions and regions to strengthen their common identities and associations with each other, and to share their approaches to common issues and goals. Several factors account for the advancement of the ICA's goals and for the limitation of its achievements as well. Overall, however, underlying both the similar and diverse ways of dealing with archival issues is the role of archives to provide evidence of the cultural context of societies. The solutions to the challenges facing archivists today should not divide us along theoretical lines, but strive to enable all archivists to work together in fulfilling this cultural role.",

        "abstract": "The French Revolution has been widely regarded as a turning point in archival history, yet few have probed the complexity and numerous contradictions of this transitional period. Rather than smoothly ushering in a new concept of archives or archival practice, the Revolution fostered two divergent tendencies. Records and documents from the Old R\u00c3\u00a9gime were reviled and frequently destroyed, even as archival structures were developed to care for new records of the Republic, and for selected records from the past. This article explores both of these tendencies in order to provide a fuller picture of archival development during the Revolutionary period. Yet the very fervor surrounding archives during that time also provides the basis for more universal reflection. The battle over the appropriate formation and content of archives demonstrates the extent to which they are, above all, cultural institutions, and the ways in which archival documents are frequently of importance as much for their symbolism as for their content. This article concludes by examining the ways in which archives, as \"sites of memory,\" are very much products of their time, invested with a meaning that may be changed--as during the French Revolution--by changing beliefs and values.",

Lastly, this article discusses one possible model for LBL to work with other archival repositories, as they build special collections which include federal records of post-World War II science.",

        "abstract": "This extended think-piece begins by exploring the late twentieth-century philosophical trend of postmodernism, and what its fragmented, decontextualized world-view means for archives. Such a position, as taken up by some historians, posits the absence of coherence, the death of grand historical narratives, and the supremacy of relativity. Consideration of the postmodern serves as a jumping-off point for an exploration of the nature of records, and the mission of the archival profession to furnish an understanding of the documentary evidence of past societies. The discussion leads full circle to situating archivists within their own (postmodern) society and explores how current trends in appraisal and description reflect present societal concerns. Ultimately, the article concludes that there is room for archives and archivists in the postmodern world, and that archivists, with their unique perspective on reading/deconstructing the documentary traces of society, are ideally suited to make sense of it.",

The drive to disseminate new approaches in preservation management to practicing collections managers has also contributed to this new base of literature. This essay introduces recent advances in preservation administration and their implications for archival practice, through an examination of the preservation-related publications released in the last few years. It also confirms a growing interest among archivists in preservation ideas from other information management fields, particularly in the areas of selection for preservation, standard preservation assessment methods, preservation of electronic media, the use of digital technology in preservation reformatting, and specialized media preservation.",

        "abstract": "Building on a successful records management program, the Pennsylvania State University Archives launched an Electronic Records Appraisal project as an opportunity to join as a partner with administrative computing in addressing the retention and disposition of electronic records. More than 3,600 datasets from fourteen administrative and academic areas were evaluated in the twenty-seven-month project. Only fourteen datasets were appraised as having archival value, however, the vast majority lacked sufficient documentation to make a full appraisal decision. The project's recommendations addressed this problem and also pointed out policy inconsistencies on use of confidential data. The archives has continued to work with administrative computing on electronic archiving and records management policy and process issues. This partnership helps the archives advance its services as both historical information provider and steward of institutional records in all formats of enduring value.",

As the technology matures, archivists and records managers are increasingly being asked to join imaging application development teams. How can these disciplines contribute to a successful application? This paper suggests some indicators archivists and records managers can use in evaluating imaging applications and some questions they can pose to improve the chances that the application will be a successful one. It is not the goal here to look at long-term storage and transportability issues; rather, the essay concentrates on what records professionals can do to improve the odds that an imaging application\u00e2\u0080\u0094either their own or one whose records they may someday inherit\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a success.",

While the establishment of the National Archives ensured the preservation of the public record, a quest to salvage the record of women's role in civilization was just beginning. Historian Mary Ritter Beard made a commitment to the promotion of women's archives throughout the next decades. After she failed to establish a World Center for Women's Archives at the dawn of the Second World War, Beard sought her dream in institutions of higher learning, inspiring many colleges and universities to collect source material by and about women. Smith College made the greatest commitment to support a women's archives on its campus. Beginning in the early 1940s, Mary Beard nurtured a close relationship with an ardent supporter of such an archives at Smith College, Margaret Storrs Grierson, the collection's director from 1942 through 1965. The tireless effort of these two women provided the foundation for what has evolved into one of the most widely recognized woman's collections in the United States.",

In many cases, administrators are the primary user population. Past archival studies, however, have focused on users with principally a historical purpose. The lack of research is surprising since most archival programs rely on their parent institutions for funding. This study is an initial attempt to examine administrative use and users in a university archives setting. It raises some interesting questions concerning how administrators analyze primary sources, what types of finding aids are most appropriate, and how much interpretation archivists need to do. The research suggests that archivists should look at themselves less as the historical voice in an institution and more as part of the administrative team.",

The author discusses the process and context in which nursing documents are created and how they are actually used in delivering care. Archivists concerned with hospital recordkeeping systems should note that the medical record does not fully reflect nursing activities. A sociological study of nurses' recordkeeping practices suggests that nurses engage in two types of recordkeeping: administrative and clinical. Most documents produced through administrative recordkeeping become part of a patient's medical record, while most clinical recordkeeping documents do not. Nevertheless, it is the latter type of recordkeeping that nurses find most useful in their practice.",

The documents are scanned, processed by optical character recognition technology, and stored on optical disks. By using this technology, we have gained access to materials privately held and seldom shared, since owners of the documents usually will not donate them. To help publicize the project and encourage public participation, we organized a Black History Archives Project Advisory Board, working with Virginia Union University (a nearby African-American institution) and the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia. The project owes its success to resolution of interdependent political and technical problems.",

An examination of official secrecy in apartheid South Africa establishes the context for an analysis of the country's restrictions on public access to official records at the dawn of a democratic era. While it is conceded that governments have a legitimate right to restrict access to certain information, it is argued that the restrictions in South Africa are weighted unreasonably against the public. At the same time, paradoxically, these restrictions do not provide adequate protection of certain legitimate interests--for instance, of individuals' personal privacy. Proposals are made for redefining the parameters of official secrecy.",

The mid-nineteenth century is chosen as a period prior to modern bureaucracies so that documents are not found in defining filing systems. Some six hundred documents are studied individually and characterized collectively. They are examined not to tell a story, however, but for evidence of their creation and maintenance and of their physical types, functional characteristics, and relations between authors and recipients. The study reveals the fruitfulness of such an orientation to documents, which complements traditional historical uses that emphasize document content.",

Archivists have been invaluable but largely unsung allies in the explosive growth of a new revisionist literature. Through the preservation of long-ignored and oftendiscarded records and manuscripts, archivists provided the means enabling historians to answer many new questions, not only about prostitution but about the history of sexuality. Yet some of these sources raise provocative and controversial problems for historians and archivists documenting the history of sexuality.

She describes the influence that early twentieth-century Weberian bureaucracy had on archival principles, and she suggests linkages with theories that precede the Second World War and were the basis for the Schellenberg bulletin. She shows how archival theories and debate were overlaid by the political impact of the Cold War confrontation before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, noting that since that time, archives have been able to assume their role as windows on government. Now archives must clarify their tools and methods to ensure that traces of decision-making processes are visible and transparent. Different methods, such as documentation strategy and acquisition strategy are discussed in the context of their impact on daily work in archives.",

The challenge for the next few years will be to capitalize on these opportunities to build a sustained leadership effort. SAA's recently adopted strategic plan calls on the Society to exert leadership on significant archival issues by shaping policies and standards, building effective coalitions, and improving public awareness of the value of archives. The author discusses some issues that the Society should address as it moves to implement this goal.",

        "abstract": "After President Richard M. Nixon resigned his office under threat of impeachment, Congress seized his White House papers for the continuing Watergate trials and investigations. With some justification, Nixon vigorously argued that the records were his private property, and thus began an extraordinary legal campaign to reclaim them. Nixon's protracted legal fight has not only caused the overturning of the historical tradition of private ownership of presidential records but has generated an important legacy of constitutional law concerning the presidential prerogatives of the separation of powers and executive privilege. Although Nixon lost his case for ownership before the Supreme Court, he has since managed to block the National Archives and Records Administration from releasing the majority of his White House records. Nixon's continuing and highly effective lawsuits against the National Archives raises the question of who really controls the White House materials of the Nixon presidency.",

It argues that archivists should understand such issues as: the mixture of practical and symbolic values in records; the effects of symbolic meaning on the forms that records take; the occasions when the act of recordmaking is more significant than the record itself; the ceremonial uses of records; and both the reverence for and the hatred of records as objects.",

The institutionalization of increasingly specialized archives distinct from libraries and other scribal enterprises is illustrated by early formation of the Archivo de la Corona de Arag\u00c3\u00b3n in Barcelona, and the transition between information technologies is shown in the famous royal cartulary, the ",

Should the state coordinate public awareness campaigns and educational programs statewide? What should be the scope and the methods of state programs, who should decide, and how?

R. Schellenberg and other traditional writers on the appraisal of public and corporate records.

By doing so, the profession will not only build a larger advocacy base for its fiscal support but will also help create a citizenry more aware of the sources and value of history and heritage.",

The authors tested methodologies for making archival description for public computer conferences of historical value more rigorous and accurate than would be possible using only traditional archival approaches. In their study of the Wing:Span public conference at the University of Michigan, the authors found that a considerable amount of additional and more precise descriptive information could be generated by using unobtrusive observation and statistical techniques to gather and analyze data. They recommend replication of the most productive and cost-beneficial of these methods in the study of other public conferences to assess their potential value as tools to enhance existing archival descriptive methodology.",

The author warns against the untutored embrace of the \"cutting-edge\" of new technology. Instead, he suggests the need for study and reliance on standards, as well as the adoption of a process-oriented view for preservation management to deal with rapid technological change. He discusses the effects of automation on archival theory, presents common sense guidelines, and includes a brief analysis of specific magnetic and optical storage media. He also proposes a new archival law: With each new storage medium, archivists must reexamine their theory and expect to meet new preservation challenges.

The German archivist has always put preservation before destruction; the English archivist has wished to defer to the office of origin for decisions on records retention. In addition to these two national variations, the author expands his review to include the Norwegian, eastern European, and United States archival contexts. He probes the variety of archival theories and practices of these countries, and concludes with observations on the further development of appraisal criteria in light of automation, market value theory, and democratization in eastern Europe.",

The national archivists of the twelve countries are preparing archival policy to be discussed by the European Council of Ministers. High on this agenda will be the harmonization of legislation and practice concerning access. Harmonization is also sought in appraisal policies, in standards for buildings and equipment, in the adaptation of new technologies, in copyright protection, and in procedures for the lending of documents. Such harmonization among national archives would hopefully match efforts to establish a coherent archival policy for the records of European Community institutions. The author does not advocate a total archival integration but does favor a structure which would allow for the free communication between archival systems and which would foster equal access and care for European archives.",

        "abstract": "In Scandinavia, a complex set of historical factors has contributed to the state's virtual monopoly on institutionalized archives until fairly recently. The authors reflect upon this tradition as they consider the more recent development of state and local archives in Denmark. Within the last 150 years, voluntary associations have supported the development of local historical collections. The major changes in Denmark's administrative structure within the last twenty-five years have challenged both the state's monopoly of institutionalized, professional archives and the independence and \"amateur\" status of local historical collections. The authors anticipate an analogous disharmony at the level of the records of the European Community, since there will be a struggle to adapt the existing European archives structure to the demands of new forms of supranational administration.",

The rule of the Communist Party after 1945 created severe limitations on access to the state archival fond for both foreigners and citizens of Eastern Middle European countries. Access was limited by a catalogue of prohibited research topics, by undetermined opening dates, by the exemption of certain fonds from existing archives legislation, by the ability of records creating bureaucracies to set their own access rules, and by national isolation. With democratization, archival administrations are instituting legislation to determine access dates, to regulate classification of documents, to guarantee public access and the protection of individual rights and privacy, and to standardize research rules. The problem of documenting re-privatized businesses is being handled in differing ways throughout the region.",

        "abstract": "Archivists' interest in expanding their academic clientele beyond historians has prompted them to consider the informational needs of researchers from other disciplines. Surveys of institutional users and citation studies of publications show that political scientists and public policy specialists have made little use of archival sources; but a careful analysis of political science literature reveals that changes in the discipline may be reversing its long-standing behaviorist antipathy for humanistic and historical inquiry. An understanding of these changes can inform effective archival outreach efforts to encourage research use of archives.",

Over the years the concept has been elevated to a theoretical construct and has been extended to include description as well as arrangement. However, descriptive systems that actually apply the concepts of levels of arrangement and description have been few and far between. Neither standard reporting to the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections nor the development of the MARC Archival and Manuscripts Control format have furthered the integration of description at differing levels. Holmes's levels seem to have had little impact on the development of automated archival systems. Has the theory been invalidated or just denied?",

The major task for archivists today is to rehabilitate, to reform, and to integrate the archival profession into the new social order. The first steps in the right direction have been taken.

There has been tremendous progress in normalization of access and working conditions, along with an increase in foreign projects and collaborative ventures, although some archives still retain the characteristics of a closed society. Captured Nazi records and other foreign archival materials brought back to Moscow at the end of World War II remain sealed in the \"Special Archive,\" but their existence has finally been admitted. Significant problems continue to affect archival research, and other serious archival problems remain in the areas of appraisal and acquisition of records, and a lack of adequate archival security, storage, and reproduction facilities, many of them related to the country's economic and political crisis. Reduced budgets have forced archives to assume more financial responsibility by moving toward a fee-for-service basis, even as they have been given more autonomy from centralized control. The author discusses efforts through the end of 1990 to provide a legal structure for archival reform through attempts to draft a new law governing archives and resulting conflicts within the archival community.

Campus-wide programs were identified at approximately one-third of the 449 responding colleges and universities, particularly at public institutions subject to state legal requirements for public accountability. The survey also identified widespread implementation of decentralized, office-centered records management programs by registrars and other campus officials. Archivists accounted for most of the survey respondents reporting no campus-wide programs. College and university archivists have long been tireless supporters of academic records management, believing that records management responsibility provides a legally mandated means to identify and accession records of enduring value. But archivists should modify their traditional approach to records management in order to implement and maintain viable programs.",

The Estonian archival community is fighting what it considers to be a Soviet campaign to control Estonian archives by subordinating the state archives under the Ministry of Justice. Estonian archivists are addressing the problems of excessive access restrictions and the lack of adequate material and technical facilities. Perhaps most importantly, work began in 1989 on the drafting of an Estonian archives law to regulate the reorganization of archives in independent Estonia.",

It is argued here that the idea is more than a metaphor and is supported by theories that would view collections of documents and material artifacts as means of extending the temporal and spatial range of communication. Archives, along with other communicational resources such as oral and ritual tradition, help to transfer information\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thereby sustain memory\u00e2\u0080\u0094from generation to generation. Two examples illustrate the interrelationship of archives and memory within this broadened view of communication and culture. The first arises from attempts to find ways to warn future generations of the location of radioactive waste repositories. The second revolves around pressure to efface from cultural landscapes evidence of tragic events that people wish to forget.",

        "abstract": "In the 1980s, librarians and archivists accepted responsibility for conservation management as a vitally important aspect of their work. Their increased role in this area influenced research and development trends towards a concentration on mass techniques. These included environmental control with emphasis on preservation rather than creature comfort, fire prevention, and disaster recovery, but developments in mass deacidification have eclipsed all else. And now there are indications that developments in the mass strengthening of paper could make mass deacidification by itself obsolete. Archivists need to become familiar with these developments so as to evaluate their use and/or modify them to suit particular archival needs.",

The author calls for the development of a selection methodology that identifies both the most endangered and the most significant documentary records in order to establish priorities for preserving them. Selection for preservation must be built into every aspect of a repository's collections management, from the initial decision to acquire a collection onwards.",

Fostering lines of communication with preservation educators will lead us to a better understanding of what will be required to address our needs. The authors advocate assessing archival needs while carefully considering implications for the future in an information environment. They emphasize the difference between preservation personnel needs in libraries and archives, examine formal education training opportunities currently available, and suggest ways to improve archival preservation training.

The author argues that archival retrieval will be enhanced by placing more emphasis on increasing the number of access points and less on achieving consistency in indexing. He describes various kinds of authority files and identifies several (occupation, time period, geographic coordinates, form-of-material, and function) that offer the most promise. He advocates the use of existing reference files and cooperative development of new ones, to be used not only in the traditional authority-control sense but also as valuable information resources in their own right.",

They focus on catalog entries in systems using the USMARC bibliographic format, with special attention to retrieval issues in catalogs shared by archival, rare book, and visual material collections.

By the mid-nineteenth century, the ABS more closely resembled a modern national nonprofit corporate bureaucracy. Important changes in institutional recordkeeping accompanied and reinforced this change in mission. Increasingly, ABS field agents and employees were discouraged from presenting rich narrative reports, and were required to quantify their work into narrow statistical compilations. Recordkeeping case studies, sensitive to the broader process of institutionalization, can contribute to bureaucratization theory, expose institutional power relationships, and help archivists better appraise the informational value and limitations of their collections.",

The AMC format has the potential both to support successful automation of archival control and to transform the bibliographic utilities as we know them today. Specifically, AMC overthrows the bibliocentricism, the political hegemony, and the existing financial/functional underpinnings of the bibliographic networks. It opens the ways to multimedia cultural information systems and new local/national systems architectures.

The professional archivist has the responsibility to balance the conflicting interests of heirs, donors, collectors, researchers, and home institutions. An examination of the access problems associated with the restricted papers of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Sigmund Freud, and recently opened files on Ferdinand Marcos and Kurt Waldheim reveals the difficulties inherent in implementing such a deceptively simple principle. Several hypothetical situations are posed to demonstrate the practical difficulties of implementing the concept of equal access to open collections.",

In the 1970s, changing responsibilities and increased complexities for archivists created a need for a comprehensive code of ethics. A Society of American Archivists committee wrote a code, which was adopted by the Society. The author, who chaired that committee, compares the code with the statement written in 1955 for the National Archives and with the codes of similar professions. General adherence to the principles in day-to-day practice and continuing discussion of ethics will lead to reevaluation and revision of the code of ethics.",

While its merits and potential effects have been debated extensively, there are other contexts in which it should be considered, including as an example of the broader phenomena of professionalization and credentialism, as a means to define competencies for use in employment decisions, and as a generic aspect of the behavior of a professional association. Yet, these perspectives have not been brought to bear sufficiently on either side of the issue. To illustrate some of the larger dimensions of certification, this article reviews sociological and historical analyses of the professionalization process, human resource management studies of competency, legal issues, and case studies of four other occupational groups. It concludes with a commentary on archival certification and suggestions for the profession.",

The author discusses organizational development in the context of an archival institution which, for a period of time, implemented the organizational development theory. The article concludes that unless the managers and individuals of an institution are truly committed to a progressive and humanly responsive management approach that values the processes of the organization and the development of the employee, archival institutions may remain mired in their own management deficiencies, thereby affecting the ultimate goal of an organization\u00e2\u0080\u0094to create an environment that is responsive both to the goals of the profession and the needs of the individual.",

There is a growing awareness of the need to \"read\" the often obscure meanings in nontextual media. In addition, there is a need to understand how various technologies impinge on communication in such a way as to change bureaucratic process and the meaning of the act or decision entered in the record, which may look the same but ceases to have the same authority, especially as the age of the computer is already evincing certain characteristics analogous to preliterate society. The relationship of physical or oral acts to their record is discussed and, thereafter, the impact of writing and print on bureaucratic and administrative textual material. There is good evidence that not only is a knowledge of form and phraseology important in the study of modern diplomatics, but also the technology which has its own cultural impact on the user, including the archivist. The archivist has to assess this as part of the appraisal process and in order to assist the user in the interpretation of meaning over and above that of content and context.

The lack of a sufficient number of full-time faculty is the weakest aspect of the current system of education for archivists. Drawing on the extensive literature on education for professions, especially librarianship, the author speculates on the advantages for the archival profession of a larger number of faculty, sketches an appropriate role for such a faculty, and encourages further development of a more complete system of archival education.",

This inattention to the training of reference archivists reflects the field's general indifference to the reference process relative to other archival concerns. This article, through a selected survey of the literature, suggests that only in the last decade have archivists begun to examine critically the reference process and to recognize the shortcomings of archival finding aids and reference personnel. Several archivists have suggested ways of improving archival finding aids, but few have addressed the issue of personnel expertise. This author recommends increased formal education and suggests potential topics of study.",

He also argues that, because of the murky distinction between preappointment and postappointment education, both SAA and the regional archival associations share a common primary mission: to fill the gaps that exist in the present network of graduate archival education opportunities. To do so, archival associations need to (1) pay closer attention to the graduate programs and learn where gaps exist, (2) examine more closely some of their past assumptions concerning archival education in light of recent information, and (3) take a broader view of how their efforts may contribute to the development of the archival profession generally in addition to serving the needs of their primary constituency.",

Yet, the archival profession has much to do in developing appraisal theory and practice that cope effectively with modern documentation. This essay starts with the recently published report on the profession's goals and priorities, and proposes a research agenda that could strengthen archival appraisal and the profession's ability to document society. The authors suggest research projects to examine the nature of the documentary record, to determine the interrelatedness of archival records, to assess how to deal with the growing quantity of automated records, to relate the development of automated descriptive systems to appraisal, and to assess the quality of the documentary record. The authors also describe the potential value of documentation strategies in dealing with some of these appraisal concerns.",

For this reason, the study of the uses and users of archives must be the goal of a research agenda for the profession, and the social sciences and information theory may provide the models archivists need to conduct such research. The aim of archival research should be to study systematically the relationship between the use of information and the ways in which it is or can be provided; it is from this relationship that the value of records and the information they contain will be determined and archival practices defined. Highest priority must be given to a national study of use in order to establish a baseline of information against which to measure and compare access and retrieval, reference service, acquisitions, management, appraisal guidelines, and documentation strategies.",

This article reviews the long story of religion in the region and focuses in particular on developments since the Second World War. The more important influences in this time include changes in economic and social life, suburbanization, changing traditions within particular denominations, growing ecumenical activity, and the use of mass media by religious professionals. The article concludes with a series of suggestions for how archivists, both individually and collectively, can identify and preserve documentation for these subjects.",

At first limited to the summer, tourism now flourishes in every season; once limited to the leisure class, it is now available to nearly everyone, and ethnic, racial, and religious exclusion has been reduced. Sources for tourism and recreation are either lacking or hard to find. This article describes some types of tourism, its history, and existing documentation of various kinds of resorts and recreational activities, and points to the possibilities for and difficulties of a documentation strategy.",

Fortunately, American archival literature has shown steady and considerable improvement over the years, but archivists still must grapple with some serious problems challenging their literature; more importantly, the archival profession's future partly depends on the resolution of problems such as those that affect its literature. This essay reviews the history of archival writing in the United States, analyzes the development of this literature, evaluates obstacles to archival research and publication, and recommends actions for the improvement of the literature.",

Collection analysis, the evaluation of the characteristics of a repository's holdings, attempts to systematize and bring more planning to the collecting process. Between 1980 and 1986 three midwestern state historical repositories conducted collection analysis studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Minnesota Historical Society, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, and Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Staff members analyzed the manuscript holdings to determine what topics their collections documented, and in what number. The quantified data was reviewed in detail and eventually resulted in the development of new collecting priorities and strategies. The analysis was a useful managerial tool that brought greater consciousness to the collecting process. Its value, however, went beyond individual repositories to foster interinstitutional cooperation.",

In the following decades their numbers increased to 33 percent of the membership and that percentage held through the 1970s. Yet women's participation in the formal activities of the Society was well below the percentage of women members in the Society. Furthermore, until the 1970s little thought was given by the Society to the interests of women. This article examines and analyzes the status and role of women in the Society of American Archivists from its inception to the establishment in 1972 of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Archival Profession. Included are a discussion of the inequities and obstacles to participation present in the Society, and descriptions of the women who participated and their contributions.",

The author examines the several approaches and practices used by fourteen state archival programs to administer access to restricted records. Included are in-depth studies of Indiana and Michigan. Utilizing the results of this survey and building upon the studies of Virginia Stewart and others, the author proposes that archivists/records administrators become more active on the access question and that they better appreciate the program objectives to be achieved when addressing access administration. The Georgia Records Act is offered as a basis for the development by NAGARA and SAA of a comprehensive model law and a more systematic understanding of the administration of access to public records.",

More broadly, it addresses the ongoing debates over the triangle of relationships among appraisal, current use, and historical scholarship. The study's findings show that most social historians continue to rely regularly on archives in their research. Patterns of use vary significantly according to time period, research orientation, and subject. Social historians use collections in older historical societies and collections of personal papers extensively, but rarely draw on state and local public archives. The numerical distribution by time period of the types of series used and their relative importance in articles may help predict future patterns of archival use.",

The framework presented here is a first attempt to structure a comprehensive program of user studies.

The author illustrates how parts of the framework can be implemented as an ongoing program through the use of a reference log and suggests applications of the framework at the personal, repository, and professional levels.",

Although archivists have made tremendous strides in the development of professionalism, especially over the past decade, recent self-assessments reveal that their profession still has serious deficiencies. This essay, using sociological models and examples of other professions, attempts to analyze some of the reasons for these problems and suggests an agenda of issues for archivists' consideration. The article discusses society's image of the archivist and its understanding of the archival mission, archivists' need to develop a stronger national voice, problems with archival education, the purpose of individual certification and institutional accreditation, and the need for archivists to acquire a broader notion of their own potential. While an improved professionalism is not the only solution to the problems archivists face, it is certainly a means for working towards their mission and its goals.",

This article examines three areas: how the laws of the last decade, particularly the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, have affected record-keeping practices within units at one large public institution; how archivists and records managers at selected universities manage and appraise student records; and the effect on the research community of those appraisal decisions and the limited accessibility of student records and records containing personally identifiable information in general.",

The changing structure of modern institutions and the use of sophisticated technologies have altered the nature of records, and only a small portion of the vast documentation can be kept. Archivists are challenged to select a lasting record, but they lack techniques to support this decision-making. Documentation strategies are proposed to respond to these problems.",

In 1984, on the fiftieth anniversary, the author of this article looked back on the thirty years since Posner's assessment and carried his analysis forward. The review, which specifically excluded theoretical contributions to records management, concludes that since 1954 there have been two main periods of archival theorizing at the National Archives, with significant contributions during each one: the first from 1954 to 1966, which produced the classic written formulations of the archival theories developed during the period 1934-1954; the second from 1966-1984, which brought important advances in the theory of access to archival materials.",

The evidence suggests that although one-third of the sample respondents recognize the dilemma of competing values, most do not find it difficult to decide which value is preeminent. The findings suggest that policies and practices for responding to requests for restricted records are not well developed. Institutional constraints place a low priority on access to confidential records for social research, archivists are not well informed about confidentiality and access statutes, and archivists are not politically active.",

This article explores the ramifications for archivists using standards relating to cataloging codes, name authorities, and subject headings. In addition to explaining the importance of these standards as they relate to both the demands of the format as well as traditional archival principles, some suggestions are made to help ease the archivists into this \"brave new world\" of automation-induced library-archives coexistence.",

State archival agencies, however, can and should develop programs in partnership with the counties and municipalities. North Carolina's local records program, which observed its silver anniversary in 1984, remains unique in the country. While it is not reviewed here as a model for emulation, this program does suggest that a state-financed local records program both feasibly and effectively conquers the paper mountains that have accumulated over the centuries.",

Although many social historians use computers, this is not the most significant feature of the New Social History (NSH). More important implications for archivists and manuscripts curators arise from the use of new kinds of source materials and from a new approach to social inquiry and interpretation. Archivists who have attempted to respond to the challenges posed by NSH have tended to attack the problem piecemeal, dealing only with isolated aspects. Recognizing the highly interactive nature of archival functions, this study provides an overview of NSH's impact on all major aspects of archival practice and management. Traditional archival concerns such as solicitation strategies, appraisal criteria, provenance, and arrangement and description options are re-examined to assess the impact of NSH, point out some serious implications for archivists, and provide a starting point for institutional self-assessments and integrated planning.",

Since 1978, the Houston Metropolitan Research Center (HMRC) of Houston Public Library has been addressing this situation by systematically building a collection of materials relative to the history of Houston's Mexican American populace. These materials include the papers of prominent Mexican American Houstonians, Mexican American families, as well as local Chicano organizations and institutions. Additionally, HMRC has established a supplementary oral history project especially designed for its Mexican American community. To implement this collection strategy, HMRC staff members have actively built a local support network and have become involved in public outreach. As one of the few such programs in the United States, HMRC's Mexican American project could serve as an example for other appropriate institutions dealing with the heritage of this important ethnic group.",

Because social history archives typically have less than complete knowledge of the records available in their collecting universe, coherent guidance, flexibility, and a means for ongoing reassessment become equally important requirements of an effective collecting policy. This paper is a description of the process employed by the Research Library of the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies to develop a viable collecting policy and to implement an active collecting program. The process entails a cyclical approach to policy development and a careful consideration of collecting strategies.",

The experience of an old and important regional repository, the Western Reserve Historical Society, particularly its Cleveland Regional Ethnic Archives Program begun in 1971, is the central focus of this article. The author describes how the society's collecting policy was defined and examines the evolution of collecting practice within the bounds of that policy. The successful implementation of the original policy has depended especially on three factors: good working relations with ethnic group leaders, selectivity within the scope of the policy, and cooperation among repositories.",

Schellenberg derived many of the practices used to appraise modern records and identify some problems in the widespread use of his approach. As an alternative, they offer a model comprised of the elements that should be considered when making an appraisal decision. Three interrelated categories of elements are discussed: value-of-information, costs-of-retention, and implications-of-the-appraisal-recommendations. While the focus is upon the appraisal of university administrative records, this model represents another step toward the development of a more systematic understanding of the entire appraisal process.",

Professional literature that could provide guidance, either by example or by prescription, for the disposition of these files, is virtually nonexistent. This article attempts to take a first step to remedy that situation by identifying the kinds of papers most likely to appear in legislators' files, discussing the conditions of their creation and official use, and suggesting their possible usefulness to a variety of potential researchers. Rather than finding a model or a list of ready-made appraisal decisions, however, readers are asked to consider various alternatives and to draw their own conclusions based on the needs of individual repositories with their own collecting policies and obligations to parent agencies or user constituencies.",

Certain agencies each year select for transfer to the National Archives case files of important cases in accordance with selection schemes that were devised as far back as forty years ago. This large and inexorably increasing body of records is seldom used and almost never for the reasons for which it was selected\u00e2\u0080\u0094importance and precedent. The agencies publish in considerable detail their important and precedential decisions and the reasoning leading to these decisions; and these published reports, rather than the case files, are widely used. The relatively few users of the case files are almost always seeking in these files incidental information concerning various subjects that usually have little or no relation to the importance of the cases. The article urges appraisers to keep in mind an obligation to the taxpayer of justifying the cost of maintaining in perpetuity such an ever-increasing body of records, and to the researcher of selecting cases for which there is a reasonable expectation that their future use will justify such cost. Attempting to balance these two considerations leads to the conclusion that such appraisals are not likely to approach perfection and that the best appraisal is that which does the least harm.",

The time required for different segments of the processing activity was averaged and analyzed for all accessions within a given time period, with size and type introduced as variables. The analysis proved useful in planning staff responsibilities, processor assignments, budgets, and other management data. The feasibility and efficacy of word processing applied to the creation of finding aids was also tested. This survey serves as a starting point for archives searching for a methodology to measure the work of processing within their institutions, as a step towards the standardization needed for self-evaluation, and, perhaps, as a means of furthering cooperation among institutions.",

Until 1975, separate committees dealt with the two facets of computerization. Then the Committee on Automated Records and Techniques launched a broad program of publications, presentations, and projects dealing with both concerns. Many of these activities echoed the efforts and concepts of previous committees. In addition, the Society of American Archivists addressed other facets of automation through the National Information Systems Task Force and its publications program. This progress, however, came in spite of problems resulting from ongoing questions about the proper organizational structure to deal with automation, from communication problems within the Society, and from new technological challenges.",

Almost one-fifth of the 979 institutions surveyed were active in one or more of these areas. Findings include the need for more emphasis on appraisal and preservation in the development of machine-readable archives, the probable increase in the use of microcomputers and database management systems for internal control, and the probable development of closer integration of archives and libraries as library automation begins to be more accommodating to archival needs. Educational issues remain highly important. While archivists may not need to be expert programmers, a greater grasp of computer capabilities and the environment of computer professionals is needed both to preserve the machine-readable record and to utilize automated techniques in physical and intellectual control.",

By 1970 development of videotape, field cameras, and video recorders had made video recording available as a tool to historians. A video recording of an interview can help scholars observe and understand the environment and the nonverbal elements of the interview, including the interviewee's appearance and body language. Unfortunately, because of confusion and competition in the video industry, archivists and scholars must choose among many video formats of varying quality and applicability.",

The term sampling as used in archival literature usually means either to cull from a large records series the most significant files or documents (subjective sampling) or to select statistically a small portion from a large universe that will accurately reflect all important aspects of the larger universe (statistical sampling). The former method has been employed for a generation and has been applied in those records series in which only the exceptional case is worthy of preservation. Statistical sampling, on the other hand, has been used to capture the typical cases in a series. The effectiveness of either method, and indeed the decision to sample itself, must always be rooted in the professional judgment of those archivists most familiar with the historical value of the materials they administer.",

They grappled with problems that still plague us. When the National Archives was founded, standardized training was seriously discussed. Samuel Flagg Bemis was appointed to chair the first SAA Committee on Education and Training. Beginning in 1939, American University offered courses in archival administration, but no attention was paid to the needs of manuscript curators. During the 1950s some archivists questioned their professional status and identity and proposed certification and rigorous SAA membership requirements. Their proposals were not implemented. Since a considerable number of archivists are trained historians, it is surprising that we have neglected to examine our own history before embarking on solutions to the lack of standardized education for archivists.",

        "abstract": "The amassing of a national collection of books and related materials has been a continuing objective ever since the enactment of the first legal deposit law, the Ordonnance de Montpellier of 1537. There are various degrees of comprehensiveness, from deposit only in connection with copyright, to deposit of all printed information (and, by analogy, information in any other medium). The information revolution of the twentieth century is closely associated with the media revolution, and by 1984 permanent preservation of all information in national repositories has become a utopian goal. Modern reprography and new media have changed the materials of archives and libraries and complicated the distinction between them. Reprography has created problems of definition for Scandinavian national libraries, whose collections are based on deposit from printers. Much of the grey, or non-conventional, literature that is presently being discussed by information scientists can be identified as documents that were formerly reserved for the archives. It is suggested that archivists and librarians cooperate in defining their fields of collection and in revising their methodologies in the light of new technology, in order to cope with the massive amounts of material.",

The former approach involves records management, and the latter involves information management. Automation makes it possible for a repository to employ both approaches in one integrated system. Reasons why this has not yet occurred involve theoretical, practical, and financial considerations. The author reviews an automation \"wish list\" and suggests how the computer, which can arrange, remember, count, and communicate data, may be used in relation to archival functions, which involve appraisal, accession, preservation and conservation, records processing and management, description, and information retrieval and reference. The essay concludes with important questions to be answered when considering automation and some suggestions as to ways archivists might employ innovations in the making of a modern archives.",

Basic criteria for preservation procedures must first be firmly defined, including conservation work on the materials to be displayed and establishment of a suitable display environment. Once the criteria are fixed, implementation requires constant attention by a trained staff capable of enforcing the criteria while meeting design and content needs of exhibitors. Even when these standards are included in the planning, there are no guarantees of success. Factors beyond the control of the archivist often arise, and the Kennedy Library experience illustrates many of the difficulties that may be encountered. The archivist not only must be an expert in preservation but also must understand the complexities of executing and fabricating the exhibit and must be included in making the manifold decisions concerning the exhibit. Only then can some degree of success in meeting sound preservation criteria be assured.",

Mention is made of services and equipment archivists should consider for the researcher working in their specific holdings, and the attitudes of archival personnel is discussed. Good service in university archives as well as disastrous efforts of some county archives are considered. Specific needs of the researcher are presented; and the dependency of the researcher on the ability, expertise, and cooperation of archivists is emphasized.",

The author suggests that there may well be other factors involved in collection management but concludes with an admonition to all archivists to seek alternative courses of action rather than habitually following practices of the past.",

It is clear that the traditional ways of operating are being transformed. The continuing excellence of libraries and archives will depend on the ability to direct this transformation. Collection management\u00e2\u0080\u0094the systematic, planned, documented process of building, maintaining, and preserving collections\u00e2\u0080\u0094provides effective tools to shape archival collections in the future. Specifically, it encompasses four components. Planning is the most essential function in collection management, and the development of a written collection development policy is a crucial step in this planning process. A second important aspect of collection management is efficient selection or acquisition of needed materials. The third component of collection management is the ongoing evaluation and analysis of collections. Finally, fundamental to collection management is the concept of cooperative collection development and resource sharing. In summary, collection management aims to apply the basic components of the planning process to building and maintaining collections.",

Collecting policies can also assist the curator in fulfilling the mission of the manuscript collection, but guidelines for producing such policies have not yet been formulated. A method for dealing with the complexity of manuscript collecting must be devised. The American Library Association does provide a beginning with its \"Guidelines for the Formulation of Collection Development Policies,\" but these guidelines are not designed for manuscript collections. A model that can be used to develop a well-planned, written collection policy for manuscripts is needed. Included in this study are suggested ways of developing written collecting policies for manuscript collections. Also considered are such matters as goals and objectives, deaccessioning, research potential of materials, and procedures for carrying out policies. The basis for a model outline for formulating collecting policies is developed through an examination of appropriate literature.",

Such broad-scale review is warranted only when the generally applied standards of appraisal at an institution are erroneous, when there is systematic error rather than possible misjudgment in applying those standards in specific cases. The proper time for reappraising and possibly deaccessioning records is during the processing of newly accessioned records, which may render old ones redundant or irrelevant to the changing nature of the holdings.",

The authors of this article extend the work of that conference by offering a critical look at mature networks. The first author reviews the development of archival networks and compares the reasons behind their establishment to the realities of daily operation. The second author analyzes the extent to which archival cooperation exists in five areas: local government records, acquisitions, collection use, resource sharing, and conflict resolution. The third author examines the effectiveness of archival networks in terms of funding and structure.",

Franklin Jameson's key lieutenant in the battle for the establishment of the National Archives, second president of the Society of American Archivists, and long time head of the American Council of Learned Societies. Special attention is given to Leland's affiliation with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, his activities as AHA secretary, and his close relations with Jameson. Also discussed are Leland's support for the archival educational activities of Ernst Posner and Leland's efforts to keep the position of Archivist of the United States free from partisan politics. The article explains how the SAA's Leland Prize for noteworthy publications owes its origins to an excess of money collected for the portrait painting of Leland which hangs in the National Archives.",

The increasing concern of archivists with conservation, security, and ethical use of records, and the rapidly developing technology for the automated creation, storage, and retrieval of records, have widened the gulf between the historical and archival professions. The ties between them, however, are far from severed. Many archivists belong to and participate in historical organizations and vice versa. Historians and archivists also continue to be allied in committees representing their mutual professional interests and in numerous documentary publication projects. Training in archival administration, in whatever subject, such as science or literature, is required by an archives and, for the foreseeable future, in the use of computers, is essential for archivists. Unless, though, such training is based on a solid educational background in history and historical methodology, archivists are not adequately prepared for their profession.",

The differences that previously divided archivists from historians in particular are rooted in practices and perceptions on both sides which the documentation explosion and the historiographical revolution of the recent past have made obsolete. The need to control technology on behalf of scholarship rather than the reverse should unite archivists, librarians, and curators with all those who use such materials. Moreover, as more and more documentation either is originally issued or is transferred for preservation purposes to new formats such as machine-readable tape, microform, and videodisc, the format-based distinctions that have been used to divide librarians from archivists should disappear, leaving both groups to confront anew the underlying problems of intellectual control of and access to information in whatever medium it appears.",

Procedures for the determination of the fair market value of manuscripts are analyzed in detail with particular emphasis on the methods of relating research value in a collection to commercial value in the marketplace. Numerous factors that can affect the value of manuscripts are discussed. Previous tax court rulings are discussed as are the archivist's and the appraiser's responsibilities should it be necessary for them to discuss the collection with the Internal Revenue Service.",

The 1976 Copyright Act clarified archivists' obligations by terminating perpetual copyright and by granting archives authority to reproduce copyrighted works under certain conditions. The ambiguous applicability of this authority and of \"fair use\" to unpublished records continues to complicate archivists' work. Archivists serve scholarship by accepting transfer of copyright in acquired records, by including information on copyright status in inventories, and by understanding copyright well enough to explain it to both researchers and copyright owners.",

States are evaluated on a possible score of fifty-four points; total scores range between a high of forty-four points and a low of eleven. Additional comments focus on the methodology and on qualitative strengths and weaknesses in the archival law of the fifty states.",

Still others are critical of surveys and call for a reevaluation of this method of records control.

Perhaps the major reason for the lack of programs in this area has been the highly technical nature of the problem. This session served a two-fold purpose: to provide information to archivists and curators regarding the latest conservation techniques, and to allow discussion on the viability of regional and national conservation centers and conservation education programs.",

A questionnaire brought responses from forty-nine states. Thirty-nine of them reported a local records program currently in operation. Slightly more than half of them are using microfilm as an integral part of the program. Many states have scheduled, or are in the process of scheduling, county and municipal records for retention and disposal. Most states report insufficient funding to provide for the proper operation of a comprehensive local records program. Adequate funding will only become available when state archival agencies campaign actively to convince state legislatures that the money is indeed needed, and the local records programs are worthwhile.",

The Memorabilia could not, of itself, generate a revival of ancient science or high civilization, however, for cultures were begotten by the tribes of Man, not by musty tomes; but the books could help, Dom Pedro hoped\u00e2\u0080\u0094the books could point out directions and offer hints to a newly evolving science.",
