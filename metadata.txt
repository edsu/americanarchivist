As yet, the practice of allowing user-contributed content has not been widely adopted, especially for large-scale online collections. Because this is not an endeavor to be entered into lightly in terms of required resources or policy considerations, it is important for decision makers to have as much information as possible about who will contribute content and what that content looks like. It is informative to look at the experience of Footnote, an entity with an existing online collection with user contribution functionality. This case study identifies individuals with family connections to a collection as the largest group of contributors, while annotations are the most common type of contribution.

Another 5.5 million pages of secret police files chronicling Hussein's Anfal genocidal campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan in the middle to late 1980s also are in American hands. These were seized by Kurdish forces in the uprising in northern Iraq in March 1991 and removed by the Pentagon in 1992 and 1993 to American soil for safe storage and analysis. Moreover, in 2005, an additional seven million pages that once belonged to the Ba'ath Party and security forces were also spirited out of Iraq by military transport with the assistance of the Iraqi Memory Foundation, a private Washington, D.C.-based group that entered Iraq as an American defense contractor to preserve the records of Saddam Hussein's regime.

Games offer a unique advantage for collecting metadata because they can entice users who might normally be inclined to visit archives to explore humanities content and, in the process, contribute to vital records, and they can work in a wide-scale, distributed fashion to collect much more metadata than a typical archives staff member could contribute alone in the same time frame. Metadata Games can be used to enhance knowledge about images associated with particular disciplines and fields, or in interdisciplinary collections. This open-source system is easily customized to meet each institution's needs. By inviting mass participation, Metadata Games opens the door for archivists, researchers, and the public to unearth new knowledge that could radically enhance scholarship across the disciplines.

The author demonstrates that gauging website accessibility requires more than software-generated compliance reports. Evaluating website accessibility necessitates the same commitment to context, nuance, and user needs as does archivists' professional imperative to establish and maintain physical and intellectual control over the archival record. The study concludes by highlighting the positive influence that the field's current increased appreciation for and use of user-based studies may have on Web accessibility initiatives.", "volume": "75", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/a716w067468262h5/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "35-55"}

The dispute over the records' past and discussion about their future reveals a larger political struggle over the custody of records seized during wartime.

Ethical arguments in favor of the seizure highlight the protection of the records as well as their accessibility to international researchers and human rights lawyers, while arguments against the seizure stress the importance of the records to the formation of national identity and nation-building in Iraq. Underlying the political, legal, and ethical arguments surrounding these records are two contrasting views of cultural property: on the one hand, cultural property is seen as an expression of national rights to which members of a nation are entitled, and, on the other hand, access to cultural property is seen as a universal human right to which all people, regardless of national affiliation, are entitled.

The establishment early in the Koryo dynasty (918-1392) of a centralized bureaucratic system required a centralized archival system, of which monastic archives were one branch. These monastic archives were managed by one of the major government departments of the secular authority and by Buddhist officials, who consisted largely of Buddhist monks.

It argues that new technologies of restoration confront the archival profession with the need to reassess traditional methodologies and to articulate new theoretical frameworks. It introduces a range of conceptual problems including the nature and status of archival materials that require restoration and reconstitution, the desire to return moving images to their original states, and the differences between object-oriented and time- or event-oriented knowledge systems. A case study discusses three distinct archival representations of Marian Anderson's Lincoln Memorial Concert in 1939, which are symptomatic of a major shift within the moving image archival field. The paper suggests that the UCLA Film and Television Archive's experimental treatment of its archival footage of this historic concert represents an exemplary departure from the field's traditional and doctrinaire orientation toward neutrality and cautiousness. In addition to their previous role as custodians of legacy materials, archivists have now also begun to operate more openly as historical agents to fill in historical gaps by producing new works.", "volume": "71", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/m421h53m66218tg1/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "2", "pages": "433-455"}

It then reports the findings of the first phase of \"Pluralizing the Archival Paradigm through Education,\" a collaborative project examining archival education in Pacific Rim nations and whether it meets the needs of Indigenous and local ethnic communities. Its findings to date suggest a need to develop and deliver culturally sensitive and responsive archival curricula and associated pedagogy inclusive of local and Indigenous knowledge and practices.

For the first half of the twentieth century, modest efforts to collect labor records were firmly rooted in the historical manuscripts tradition.

This boom ended in the 1980s, as unions faced tougher times and many institutions cut their support for archives programs. Today, the survival of labor archives programs depends on archivists forging a closer relationship with the labor movement, especially by establishing records- and knowledge-management partnerships.

The paper issues a call for archivists to rethink the way they process collections, particularly large contemporary collections.

Probably few archivists and other records professionals know that the antecedents of their profession are well represented in such a popular tourist attraction. This essay considers three lessons for archivists in their quest for greater public understanding and support, drawing on how this old public records structure has been interpreted. First, the essay suggests that the story of the Secretary's Office is not well known by archivists and those interested in the history of efforts to preserve our documentary heritage. Second, the essay recounts the story of the failure by America's premier and pioneering historic site to interpret fully the legacy of the public records office. Finally, the essay indicates that the lack of interpretation represents a lost opportunity to promote public understanding of what records represent, why archives are important, and the work of archivists.", "volume": "68", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/a4434884785t2h88/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "2", "pages": "279-296"}

Codes of ethics are placed within the context of concepts of professionalism and the relationships between and among archivists, records creators, records users, employers, and the public at large. Several codes issued by archival professional organizations are used to illustrate the ways in which the structure of codes influences their effectiveness in communicating the nature of the profession to the public. The paper concludes that ethics codes contribute to an enhanced sense of professionalism for archivists that can strengthen their ability to serve the public by creating more autonomy in decision making. Paying greater attention to the language used in constructing codes of ethics can help accomplish this task.", "volume": "67", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/mw0914r2p52xx2t4/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "11-30"}

During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, state appellate courts ruled in a series of cases that revolutionized legal thought on this subject. By the end of World War I, these tribunals increasingly assumed that citizenship itself provided sufficient justification for access to public records. Abstractors and insurers of real estate titles, whose interests were commercial, led the assault upon the common-law tradition that had imposed the more restrictive standard. Suits initiated by those concerned with the misuse of public funds and honest elections played a relatively small role in bringing about this change. The story of this landmark litigation between title abstract companies and local government officials again demonstrates that custody of public records carries with it risks and responsibilities all too familiar to modern archivists.", "volume": "67", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/27jqw876qmlj4152/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "46-57"}

The authors assert that there are three distinct forms of knowledge required to work effectively with primary sources: domain (subject) knowledge, artifactual literacy, and the authors' own concept of archival intelligence. Archival intelligence is a researcher's knowledge of archival principles, practices, and institutions, such as the reason underlying archival rules and procedures, the means for developing search strategies to explore research questions, and an understanding of the relationship between primary sources and their surrogates. This is separate from domain or subject knowledge and artifactual literacy, or the ability to interpret and analyze primary sources. Archival intelligence encompasses three dimensions: 1) knowledge of archival theory, practices, and procedures; 2) strategies for reducing uncertainty and ambiguity when unstructured problems and ill-defined solutions are the norm; 3) and intellective skills.", "volume": "66", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/q022h85pn51n5800/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "51-78"}

In 1917, when the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark, Danish archivists removed the majority of records created there during colonial rule and deposited them in the Danish National Archives. Following its establishment in the 1930s, the National Archives of the United States sent an archivist to the Virgin Islands to claim most of the remaining records and ship them to Washington. The native population of the Virgin Islands, primarily former colonials whose ancestors were brought from Africa as slaves, were left without access to the written sources that comprised their history. While all three parties have claims to custody of the records, the claim of the people of the Virgin Islands relies on an expanded definition of provenance that includes territoriality or locale, as well as on a custodial responsiblity for access. The competing custodial claims suggest a dissonance between legal custody, physical custody, and archival principles that may be resolvable through post-custodial management practices.", "volume": "64", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/h6k872252u2gr377/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "96-114"}

Many older assessments stress a more cohesive definition: the need for archivists to be all to all archives, equally representing users and administrators, creators and researchers. The challenge created by contemporary records is not to change this fundamental role, first expressed over two hundred years ago during the French Revolution, but to create new ways to fulfill it. The task requires making three crucial distinctions: between the archivist's methods and the archival mission, between the archivist's work and archival functions, and between professional issues and archival science issues. Only by learning how to strike a balance between the needs of archivists as individuals and the collective identity of the archival profession can the challenges of contemporary records be met.

The first six years of the newly formed National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) were devoted to the development of state structures to assist in the program's implementation, and national priorities that could address questions of documentary preservation and enhanced researcher use. The debates within the Commission and among archivists nationwide during the startup period centered on three questions: how much appropriated funding would be provided to the Commission for grants?; what role should the states play in shaping and implementing the program?; and what priorities should be established in order to advance the solution to national research needs? The staff, the Commission members, the Archivist of the United States, the state archivists, and the professional archival organizations all became important contributors to the initiation of the first national effort to improve archival processes and the condition of documentary resources in the United States.", "volume": "63", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/fr07u63646825565/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "18-42"}

Recent intellectual debate has examined questions of national, ethnic, gender, class, and community identities, of individual and group identity, and of the formation of identity. A spectrum of positions has emerged from this debate. On one end, identity is viewed as \"real,\" intrinsic to individuals and communities or even biologically based. On the other, identity is conceived of as social fiction, constructed culturally for political and historical reasons. On the whole, serious scholars have rejected the former view. Archivists should be cognizant of this fact because they are major players in the business of identity politics, whether they are conscious of it or not.

There has never been a time since the rise of the modern corporation when companies have not bought other companies, restructured their operations, entered new businesses, and consolidated, sold, or spun off operations. In addition to these realities, the terms downsizing and outsourcing\u00e2\u0080\u0094and all that they portend for employees\u00e2\u0080\u0094have become bywords as business\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not only business\u00e2\u0080\u0094seeks to wring more productivity from the workforce. These trends have inevitably affected corporate records. Archives and records management units have been closed and records destroyed or transferred to warehouses, while the rate of establishment and growth of in-house corporate archives has diminished greatly. If one believes that the records of business are an integral part of American history, and that the place of corporations in that history needs to be documented and accessible, then the fate of those business records and the archives themselves is a matter of some importance.

Yet the very fervor surrounding archives during that time also provides the basis for more universal reflection. The battle over the appropriate formation and content of archives demonstrates the extent to which they are, above all, cultural institutions, and the ways in which archival documents are frequently of importance as much for their symbolism as for their content.

She describes the influence that early twentieth-century Weberian bureaucracy had on archival principles, and she suggests linkages with theories that precede the Second World War and were the basis for the Schellenberg bulletin. She shows how archival theories and debate were overlaid by the political impact of the Cold War confrontation before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, noting that since that time, archives have been able to assume their role as windows on government. Now archives must clarify their tools and methods to ensure that traces of decision-making processes are visible and transparent. Different methods, such as documentation strategy and acquisition strategy are discussed in the context of their impact on daily work in archives.", "volume": "57", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/g114464381p11324/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "3", "pages": "528-542"}

The authors tested methodologies for making archival description for public computer conferences of historical value more rigorous and accurate than would be possible using only traditional archival approaches. In their study of the Wing:Span public conference at the University of Michigan, the authors found that a considerable amount of additional and more precise descriptive information could be generated by using unobtrusive observation and statistical techniques to gather and analyze data. They recommend replication of the most productive and cost-beneficial of these methods in the study of other public conferences to assess their potential value as tools to enhance existing archival descriptive methodology.", "volume": "55", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/48530jm12848r7p2/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "2", "pages": "316-330"}

He also proposes a new archival law: With each new storage medium, archivists must reexamine their theory and expect to meet new preservation challenges.

Access was limited by a catalogue of prohibited research topics, by undetermined opening dates, by the exemption of certain fonds from existing archives legislation, by the ability of records creating bureaucracies to set their own access rules, and by national isolation. With democratization, archival administrations are instituting legislation to determine access dates, to regulate classification of documents, to guarantee public access and the protection of individual rights and privacy, and to standardize research rules.

However, descriptive systems that actually apply the concepts of levels of arrangement and description have been few and far between. Neither standard reporting to the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections nor the development of the MARC Archival and Manuscripts Control format have furthered the integration of description at differing levels.

Significant problems continue to affect archival research, and other serious archival problems remain in the areas of appraisal and acquisition of records, and a lack of adequate archival security, storage, and reproduction facilities, many of them related to the country's economic and political crisis. Reduced budgets have forced archives to assume more financial responsibility by moving toward a fee-for-service basis, even as they have been given more autonomy from centralized control. The author discusses efforts through the end of 1990 to provide a legal structure for archival reform through attempts to draft a new law governing archives and resulting conflicts within the archival community. She concludes that archival ", "volume": "54", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/60h14p374l379289/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "1", "pages": "70-95"}

Although archivists have made tremendous strides in the development of professionalism, especially over the past decade, recent self-assessments reveal that their profession still has serious deficiencies. This essay, using sociological models and examples of other professions, attempts to analyze some of the reasons for these problems and suggests an agenda of issues for archivists' consideration. The article discusses society's image of the archivist and its understanding of the archival mission, archivists' need to develop a stronger national voice, problems with archival education, the purpose of individual certification and institutional accreditation, and the need for archivists to acquire a broader notion of their own potential. While an improved professionalism is not the only solution to the problems archivists face, it is certainly a means for working towards their mission and its goals.", "volume": "49", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/p0vg1v6410254574/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "3", "pages": "229-247"}

The agencies publish in considerable detail their important and precedential decisions and the reasoning leading to these decisions; and these published reports, rather than the case files, are widely used. The relatively few users of the case files are almost always seeking in these files incidental information concerning various subjects that usually have little or no relation to the importance of the cases. The article urges appraisers to keep in mind an obligation to the taxpayer of justifying the cost of maintaining in perpetuity such an ever-increasing body of records, and to the researcher of selecting cases for which there is a reasonable expectation that their future use will justify such cost. Attempting to balance these two considerations leads to the conclusion that such appraisals are not likely to approach perfection and that the best appraisal is that which does the least harm.", "volume": "48", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/jm56229574506134/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "2", "pages": "173-189"}

The information revolution of the twentieth century is closely associated with the media revolution, and by 1984 permanent preservation of all information in national repositories has become a utopian goal. Modern reprography and new media have changed the materials of archives and libraries and complicated the distinction between them. Reprography has created problems of definition for Scandinavian national libraries, whose collections are based on deposit from printers. Much of the grey, or non-conventional, literature that is presently being discussed by information scientists can be identified as documents that were formerly reserved for the archives.

The ties between them, however, are far from severed. Many archivists belong to and participate in historical organizations and vice versa. Historians and archivists also continue to be allied in committees representing their mutual professional interests and in numerous documentary publication projects. Training in archival administration, in whatever subject, such as science or literature, is required by an archives and, for the foreseeable future, in the use of computers, is essential for archivists.

The need to control technology on behalf of scholarship rather than the reverse should unite archivists, librarians, and curators with all those who use such materials. Moreover, as more and more documentation either is originally issued or is transferred for preservation purposes to new formats such as machine-readable tape, microform, and videodisc, the format-based distinctions that have been used to divide librarians from archivists should disappear, leaving both groups to confront anew the underlying problems of intellectual control of and access to information in whatever medium it appears.", "volume": "46", "pdf": "http://archivists.metapress.com/content/b32xrnw35ug03202/fulltext.pdf?page=1", "issue": "3", "pages": "286-292"}
